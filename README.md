This is simply a data scraper code for scraping from artsy.net, to be used to understand art description data in my research team. 

The images from a test scrape have also been uploaded, alongside the csv file, so that we have data for the **ID,	Date Created,	Artist,	Date Scraped,	Text Type,	Text,	Image Path,	Image Type,	Text Author,	Auction Price** . There are multiple batches with up to 90 artworks in each batch to avoid random errors. 

The code can be performed at any time on the Artsy website to take this data (the website is updated frequently with a cap of 3000 artworks in its collect page so it would be a good idea to run the code multiple times over the span of a couple months if you want to get more data).
