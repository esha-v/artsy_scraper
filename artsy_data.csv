The artist’s signature faceless figures—adrift in starkly lined, color-saturated worlds—attracted attention from collectors, the press, and fellow East Village art-world acolytes. Kostabi began exhibiting throughout the city and internationally, and his work has sold for five figure prices at auction. His paintings, along with his irreverent media appearances and opulent, three-floor mega-studio (dubbed “Kostabi World”), all commented on the absurd commercialism and commodification of art in the decades leading up to the new millennium.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch1\artsy-0000002.jpg,Painting,Martin Lawrence Galleries,13850

In portraits, landscapes, architectural details, still lifes, and everything in between, Stitt seeks the “golden moment”—the particular combination of light, contrast, and juxtaposition that gives his subjects a timeless beauty. “I would consider my work successful if a viewer saw something they would never think twice about looking at in one of my paintings, yet this time they noticed it and think it looks lovely,” he says. “And if that person then left the place where they saw the painting and went about their business, and in the course of that business noticed something else that is mundane at one of those magical moments, when it is transformed from the ordinary into the beautiful, and they stopped and noticed how lovely it is … if they did this all because my painting reminded them to do this, then my work, and my painting, has been successful.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch1\artsy-0000007.jpg,Painting,Gallery NAGA,400

Kahn’s signature landscapes took inspiration from the palettes of Henri Matisse and the ethos of his Vermont farm: He painted weathered barns, undulating pastures, and tree lines that embraced a spare, evocative New England aesthetic. Kahn studied under Hans Hofmann and cited Mark Rothko, J.M.W. Turner, and Pierre Bonnard as additional influences. He worked intuitively, refusing to overthink any psychological underpinnings in his paintings. Today, Kahn’s work can be found in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, among other institutions.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch1\artsy-0000012.jpg,Painting,Questroyal Fine Art,95000

Perrotta received her BFA from UC Berkeley and studied at the Santa Reparata International School of Art in Florence, Italy. Her work has been featured in solo and group exhibitions at galleries in Los Angeles, London, Mexico City, São Paolo, and Madrid. Residencies in Portugal, Spain, England, and Morocco opened her eyes to the lives of women in different parts of the world. Perrotta symbolically strips away cultural differences to expose the common experiences women share—like insecurities around body image and the awareness of the male gaze—and translates them into the curves and shapes of her minimal compositions.

Playing with light and shadow, Bestard’s work is at once alluring and unsettling: In Repentat (2021), a figure dressed in a dark coat kneels on the ground, its face partially obscured by wavy hair. The background surrounding the subject is charcoal black, adding to the somber tone of the work. Though he avoids labeling himself, Bestard draws on traditional Realist techniques to create paintings with Surrealist subject matter in muted palettes of greys and browns. The figures in his paintings are often depicted in uncanny, dreamlike situations: Shouting at each other, as in Shout II (2017), or balancing a flag with one hand, as in Flag bearer (2019).",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000034.jpg,Painting,Galeria Contrast,

The artist, who grew up between Japan and America, loads his large-scale canvases (sometimes irregularly shaped or divided into panels) with references to his bicultural background: He has taken inspiration from Pop art and manga, cowboys and samurai, graffiti and the Meiji era, Abstract Expressionism and woodblock printing. Matsuyama imbues his energetic scenes with a playful, high-octane color palette. The compositions often blur the boundaries between domestic interiors and the natural world. Matsuyama received his MFA from Pratt Institute in 2004. Since then, he has exhibited in Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York, among other cities.

In Death of Sardanapalus (1827), figures and animals seem to writhe across the picture plane. Like Ingres, Delacroix was fascinated by the Orient, which includes present-day Turkey, Greece, and North Africa, visiting Morocco in 1832. Yet, instead of highlighting the seductive quality of his exotic subjects, Delacroix took an avid interest in the violence and cruelty in Oriental subjects. His lush palette and passionate brushwork would later greatly influence the development of both Impressionism and Post-Impressionism",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000044.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Riva Advisory,9500

Many of his provocative pieces deconstruct and deride luxury culture, and Sachs has explicitly paired fashion brands with violent or debased subject matter. His Prada Toilet (1997) is a toilet created from cardboard Prada packaging, for example, while his Chanel Guillotine (Breakfast Nook) (1998) looks like a branded torture device.

artsy-0000057.jpg,1984,Sam Gilliam,11-04-2023,Description,"Since the 1960s, Washington Color School painter Sam Gilliam has tested the boundaries of color, form, texture, abstraction, and the canvas itself. His most significant innovations may be his “Drape” paintings: lengths of unstretched, unprimed canvases covered in fields of deeply saturated color and layers of poured paint. Gilliam drapes these works across walls or hangs them from the ceiling in a manner that can suggest theater curtains, flags, or hanging laundry. Throughout his canvases and works on paper, the artist has also employed various folding and staining techniques. His work belongs in the collections of the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Tate Modern. Gilliam has enjoyed exhibitions in New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Basel, Seoul, and Washington, D.C., among other cities. At auction, a number of his pieces have sold for seven figures. Inspired by the spirit of improvisational jazz, Gilliam continues to experiment with depth, physicality, and resonances of color.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000057.jpg,Painting,Heritage Auctions,24000
artsy-0000058.jpg,2019,David Gerstein,11-04-2023,Description,"An Israeli painter and sculptor, David Gerstein seeks to transcend the limits of two-dimensional painting via his vibrant three-dimensional sculptures. He is particularly well known for his large-scale public installations, the largest of which is Momentum (2008) in Singapore. Gerstein’s work from the 1970s focused on figurative paintings and watercolors depicting scenes from his childhood. A recurring bicycle motif in these works reappears in later pieces. Steel-cut figures first appeared in his art in the early 1980s and they continue to assist him in illustrating everything from childhood to the natural world. These themes can be seen in Nature Lover (ca. 2020), with a bicycle in silhouette combined with a burst of brightly colored butterflies that surround and follow the rider. Gerstein continues to work in paint, creating brightly colored compositions such as 20.13 (2020) that meet his desire to speak to the art world while remaining accessible to the public.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000058.jpg,Sculpture,Galerie Duret,

His style is characterized by emotive linework, a mélange of high and low cultural references, and an acute eye for the details and absurdities of city life. While his work could be humorous, Steinberg also made surreal tableaux and offered profound meditations on the post-war experience. Early in his career, the artist made advertisements that were published in magazines including Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, Fortune, and Time. Steinberg’s work has been exhibited in New York, London, Paris, Tokyo, Berlin, Los Angeles, and Copenhagen.

He arranges the layers of paper in a horizontal grid, paying homage to pioneering Modernists and Minimalists such as Piet Mondrian, Kenneth Noland, and Morris Louis. A resin topcoat renders the surface shiny and the paper transparent, so that the images on the backsides bleed through to the front, creating a sense of depth. Paying attention to what is behind each piece of paper “makes the collage more interesting and creates a certain mood,” he says. Verbicky’s collages, which can be “read” in any direction, evoke familiar scenes and subjects, from flowers in bloom, to a racetrack blurred in action, to stock tickers scrolling across a television screen.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000063.jpg,Mixed Media,L Kotler Fine Art,39000

Smith began reconstructing paintings in 2014, when he recreated Andy Warhol’s portrait of Marilyn Monroe. His works are highly sought after by international collectors. While best known for his replicas of museum masterpieces, Smith also uses color chips to reproduce movie posters, nude portraits, and still lifes of condiments. He also incorporates text into his pieces by replacing paint names on swatches with evocative words, adding a narrative layer to the work.

He bridged the gap between the art world and the street, graffiting city subways and sidewalks before committing to a studio practice. Haring united the appeal of cartoons with the raw energy of Art Brut artists such as Jean DuBuffet as he developed a distinct pop-graffiti aesthetic that comprised energetic, boldly outlined figures against solid or patterned backdrops. His major themes included exploitation, subjugation, drug abuse, and the threat of nuclear holocaust; Haring boldly engaged with social issues, especially after receiving an AIDS diagnosis in 1987. Today, his work sells for seven figures at auction and has been the subject of solo shows at the Brooklyn Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Albertina Museum in Vienna, among other institutions.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000066.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",VINCE fine arts/ephemera,24000

Mixing nontraditional materials such as silver deposit with acrylic paints, Gleason’s surfaces are highly reactive to light and shifts in the viewer’s position. Rather than using focusing on the surface as an end in itself, his paintings track the play of light and the movement of the viewer across the surface, thereby acting as a mirror onto the external world.

artsy-0000075.jpg,1985,Sol LeWitt,11-04-2023,Description,"Sol LeWitt famously stressed the importance of the ideas that animated his artwork over the particulars of their execution. A leading figure of the Conceptual and Minimalist movements, he maintained a practice that included drawing, printmaking, photography, painting, installation, sculpture, and writing. He is perhaps best known for simple, geometric drawings and wall paintings and for his “structures”: modular sculptures of cubed forms, variously constructed from steel, polyurethane, wood, or concrete. LeWitt also received attention for his writings on the nature of Conceptual art. To “install” his wall paintings, contemporary exhibition spaces must follow a set of instructions the artist left behind. LeWitt received his BFA from Syracuse University. After graduating, he took classes at the Cartoonists and Illustrators School (now the School of Visual Arts), worked as a graphic designer and, later, worked shifts at the Museum of Modern Art alongside artists such as Dan Flavin and Robert Mangold. His work has been exhibited in a number of institutions including the Museum of Modern Art, MoMA PS1, the Centre Pompidou, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and the Pérez Art Museum Miami; it also belongs in the collections of countless museums including the Tate, the Guggenheim Museum, Dia Beacon, and the Musée National d’Art Moderne in Paris.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000075.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Heritage Auctions,8000

The son of a naval officer, Slonem honed his craft at Tulane University in New Orleans and, later, at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, where he was exposed to artists including Alice Neel and Alex Katz. Today, his work sells for five figures on the secondary market and can be found in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Bahrain National Museum, and the Guilin Art Museum, among other institutions.

Rather than critique consumerist culture, Wesley’s cartoonish paintings, inspired to an extent by René Magritte and Giorgio de Chirico, celebrate fantasy and express human fears and desires. They reference popular culture (especially the comic strip “Blondie”), but fix “on the neurotic, erotically inclined psyche of the American male, with its rage and frustration, longing and loss,” according to New York Times critic Andrea K.

In 1971, he was included in the legendary exhibition “Under The Brooklyn Bridge,” organized by Alanna Heiss and Gordon Matta-Clark. His work from the 1970s frequently challenged conventional modes of display with Back Floorpiece (1979) being typical of this approach, functioning less as an aesthetic object than a series of spatial markers. He continued to believe in the power of objects to change space throughout his career, placing 39 boulders in a winding configuration in a grassy meadow at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in 1989. Although best known for his sculptural works, Nonas also produced small abstract works in oilstick on paper such as Under (Fieldnotes) (2018).",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000091.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Galerie Hubert Winter,30000

In the early 1970s, in pursuit of a more definitively feminine practice, she gave up abstract painting, which was considered the hotbed of art world machismo, to explore sculptural processes like sewing and knitting, which were traditionally defined as “women’s work.” Returning to painting in 1973, she produced a series called “Angry Women,” which announced the expressive brushwork and muddy pigment that are hallmarks of her mature style. In 1988, a trip to Eastern Europe, where she visited two concentration camps, reinforced the dark, mysteriously emotive quality of Fishman’s vigorously worked paintings, including her 1989 series of eight paintings, “Remembrance and Renewal,” in which she mixed ashes and beeswax into her paints.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch3\artsy-0000104.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Goya Contemporary/Goya-Girl Press,9100

These drawings resemble black-and-white newspaper photos from the early 20th century, and suggest a pseudo-documentary archive of the pursuits of Murrow’s characters. Although he deals with grand themes of human ambition, Murrow infuses his work with absurdist humor, revealing the comedic failure of his subjects.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch3\artsy-0000107.jpg,Sculpture,Galerie Les filles du calvaire,

Although he started out as a somewhat conventional Hudson River School painter, his poetic and symbolic moonlights of the 1890s, with their emphasis on pattern and abstract design and manipulated paint surfaces, changed the face of American art. Blakelock’s scintillating dream-like nocturnes reward close inspection for their interplay of color, tone, subtle vibration, refracted edges, jagged rhythmic patterns, and dissonant harmonies. The artist endlessly experimented with surface textures: scumbling, scraping, and even pumicing his lacquer-like pigments. Blakelock’s works are replete with analogues to nature’s underlying armature, even mimicking the organic structure visible on the microscopic level of cellular formation, or writ large in the more apparent structures of the environment, from plant morphology and animal physiology to geologic structures.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch4\artsy-0000140.jpg,Painting,Questroyal Fine Art,150000

While Avery’s subject matter was decidedly representational—the artist often captured domestic scenes and serene landscapes—his bright color palettes and pared-back compositions inspired a number of artists in the New York avant-garde including Mark Rothko, Adolph Gottlieb, and Barnett Newman. Avery studied at the Connecticut League of Art Students and the School of the Art Society of Hartford.

He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky For the Love of God (2007), a human skull studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire. Since 1988, when the artist developed and curated “Freeze,” a groundbreaking exhibition of his work and that of his Goldsmiths College peers, he has been the subject of major shows at Tate Modern in London, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In 2008, Hirst controversially staged “Beautiful Inside my Head Forever,” an auction in which he sold his work directly to the public and raked in around $200 million for himself.

Referencing comic books, classic television characters, and other pop imagery, Gross creates a witty blend of advertising, propaganda, and Surrealism. In 2012, Alex Gross’s solo exhibition, “Product Placement,” lampooned the ubiquitous and disturbing presence of product promotions and advertising in everyday life. Gross has said of the subject matter in his work: “The world that I live in is both spiritually profound and culturally vapid. It is extremely violent but can also be extremely beautiful. Globalization and technology are responsible for wonderfully positive changes in the world as well as terrible tragedy and homogeneity. This dichotomy fascinates me, and naturally influences much of my work.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch4\artsy-0000156.jpg,Painting,Haven Gallery,14000

In other works, Rosenkranz has scattered Fiji water and Gatorade bottles filled with paint or colored fluid throughout the gallery space.

Rejecting the dominant painting and sculpting modes of his day, Warhol embraced silk-screen printmaking to achieve his characteristic hard edges and flat areas of color. The artist mentored Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and continues to influence contemporary art around the world: His provocative successors include Richard Prince, Takashi Murakami, and Jeff Koons.

The Nigerian-born, U.K.-based Emefiele studied painting at Delta State University in Abraka, Nigeria, before pursuing her MFA at London’s Slade School of Art. Her layered, surreal multimedia works capture the everyday particularities of a distinctly feminine, diasporic experience; Emefiele’s settings range from a joyous dance floor to public transit during a morning commute. She has exhibited in Abuja, Lagos, London, Los Angeles, and Johannesburg, and she won first prize in the COJA Art Competition in 2003.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch4\artsy-0000183.jpg,Painting,rosenfeld,

Inspired by Existentialist philosophy and a rejection of his bourgeois childhood, Modigliani chose not to paint landscapes, like many of his contemporaries, instead using portraiture to explore both his own psychology and that of his subjects, who were typically fellow artists or lovers. Modigliani also painted highly sexualized female nudes that at the time, were daringly erotic. His style is figurative but also highly expressive, and his subjects are shown with quirks and asymmetries, recalling the portraiture of Paul Cézanne, whose work Modigliani greatly admired. Modigliani befriended Pablo Picasso after moving to Paris in 1906, and like Picasso, he drew inspiration from art of so-called “primitive” cultures, his work often resembling African or Pre-Columbian statuary.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch4\artsy-0000184.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",AUTOGRAPHES DES SIECLES,

He studied architecture and interior design in his native Chile, then developed his signature style on trips to Europe and the United States, during which he met artists such as Arshile Gorky and Salvador Dalí. Matta’s work has been exhibited widely in cities including New York, London, Santiago, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo, and Rome and belongs in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Tate, the Guggenheim Museum, and Moderna Museet, among many others.

According to Quaresma, making the series “was a process of rescuing my identity.” “In the studio space I worked over the images with geometrical lines and casual acrylic brush marks, creating a duality between documentary and imaginary.” Throughout Quaresma’s body of work, negotiations between the intimate and universal, personal and political, and physical and psychological are present and emphasized by her drawn interventions.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch4\artsy-0000193.jpg,Mixed Media,Patrick Heide Contemporary Art,

His work belongs in the collections of the Musée Guimet, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Pérez Art Museum Miami, and the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami, among others.

In his most famous works, he places words and phrases from the colloquial and consumerist vernacular atop photographic images or fields of color—a strategy that situates him within a larger Pop art lineage. Ruscha often paints and draws with unusual materials such as gunpowder, blood, and Pepto Bismol, drawing attention to the deterioration of language and the pervasive clichés in American culture. Ruscha’s work has been exhibited across the globe, and the artist has enjoyed solo shows at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and Moderna Museet, in addition to the Venice Biennale, where he represented the United States in 2005.

The New York–based artist’s work, which spans painting, printmaking, and sculpture, is equal parts Pop art serialism and gestural abstraction in the vein of Helen Frankenthaler; Metz relies on rhythmic repetition across his diptychs and triptychs and on free-flowing washes of paint. Metz has exhibited in New York, Copenhagen, Paris, and Milan, among other cities, and he has shown at institutions including Museo Pietro Canonica in Rome and the Nassau County Museum of Art in Roslyn Harbor, New York.

Taking his cues from Andy Warhol’s Pop art seriality, the artist uses repetition as a form of creative meditation which unlocks subconscious sentiment. The son of a naval officer, Slonem honed his craft at Tulane University in New Orleans and, later, at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, where he was exposed to artists including Alice Neel and Alex Katz. Today, his work sells for five figures on the secondary market and can be found in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Bahrain National Museum, and the Guilin Art Museum, among other institutions.

Defining himself as an Afrofuturist, Brantley draws from a range of influences including Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Chicago’s AfriCOBRA collective, African American history, hip-hop, anime, manga, and his own experiences of African American and urban life in the United States. He participated in the 1990s graffiti scene, tagging trains, walls, and other city surfaces. Brantley still reflects the energy and aesthetics of street art across his canvases and sculptural practice. He has exhibited in Miami, Chicago, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, among other cities.

Her canvases show the influence of both Classical compositions and Modernist geometry in equal measure. Watson’s arsenal of strokes include wide strokes of paint, energetic squiggles, dapples, and hard-edged blocking. She refers to her varied brushstrokes and mixed pigments as “moments,” each with an emotional heft and narrative weight all their own.

Over the course of his prolific career, he’s shot many of pop culture’s most recognizable faces—from Nicki Minaj, Britney Spears, and Madonna to Tupac Shakur, Michael Jackson, and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson—in a humorous style that combines elements of Surrealism and Pop art. In addition to shooting for publications such as Rolling Stone and Interview, LaChapelle has maintained a fine-art photography practice. Much of his work has explored themes of mortality and transcendence, with overt references to art history and religious iconography. He has featured in shows at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, the Musée d'Orsay, and the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., among other institutions.

artsy-0000269.jpg,1916,Charles Ephraim Burchfield,11-04-2023,Description,"Regarded as one of America’s most significant modernist painters, Charles Burchfield was known for his dark, eerie watercolor paintings of Midwestern cities and towns—and the rural landscapes and industrial developments at their edges. Drawing from subjects including design theory, European modernism, and Chinese and Japanese artmaking, Burchfield developed a unique style notable for its deeply personal symbolic language, distorted forms, and quirky, expressive elements. His early work exudes a sense of whimsy, and his depictions of architecture and nature seem alive with energy. The artist recaptured this fantastical sensibility in the 1940s, after a period of painting in a more realistic style. Burchfield rose to fame in 1930, when the newly opened Museum of Modern Art staged a show of his early work—the museum’s first single-artist exhibition. Since then, he’s been the subject of retrospectives at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Hammer Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Columbus Museum of Art.

Common motifs across Murakami’s oeuvre—which spans paintings, sculptures, prints, and more—include smiling flowers, bears, and the Mickey Mouse–inspired character Mr. DOB. They also appear throughout Murakami’s thriving market for merchandise and collectibles.

Dalí’s fantastical prints, paintings, sculptures, films, and writing helped cement the movement’s identity. Working off psychoanalytic ideas, Dalí rendered fantastical creatures and landscapes that could unsettle and awe. His 1931 canvas The Persistence of Memory is one of the most recognizable artworks of all time.

An MFA graduate of Syracuse University, Crotty is known for experimenting with the materiality of paint, repurposing plexiglass sheets as squeegees to spread pigments and coaxing tonal interactions that bewilder the eye. Some of his works appear to glow and could be mistaken for lightboxes.

Oliver has exhibited in Tokyo, Taipei, London, Basel, and São Paulo. She has also collaborated with Japanese fashion brand ADAM ET ROPÉ to make clothing that features her distinctive imagery.

He bridged the gap between the art world and the street, graffiting city subways and sidewalks before committing to a studio practice. Haring united the appeal of cartoons with the raw energy of Art Brut artists such as Jean DuBuffet as he developed a distinct pop-graffiti aesthetic that comprised energetic, boldly outlined figures against solid or patterned backdrops. His major themes included exploitation, subjugation, drug abuse, and the threat of nuclear holocaust; Haring boldly engaged with social issues, especially after receiving an AIDS diagnosis in 1987. Today, his work sells for seven figures at auction and has been the subject of solo shows at the Brooklyn Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Albertina Museum in Vienna, among other institutions.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch8\artsy-0000311.jpg,Print,Fine Art Mia,115000

He often uses spray paint and stencils in his critiques of consumerism, political authority, terrorism, and the status of art and its display.

Today, segments of Noir’s Berlin Wall murals belong to art collections around the world. The French-born, Berlin-based artist has expanded his practice to include painting, printmaking, and public art. Noir has exhibited in London (where he often collaborates with local graffiti artist Stik), Los Angeles, and Berlin.

In the 1970s, Gormley studied Buddhist meditation and philosophy in India, nearly becoming a monk before he committed to a career as an artist. He has exhibited in New York, London, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo, Brussels, and Singapore, and has mounted public sculptures throughout Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. In 1994, Gormley was awarded the Turner Prize, and in 2003, he was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Arts. In addition to his sculptures, he has produced a number of line drawings and prints. His work has sold for seven figures at auction.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch9\artsy-0000366.jpg,Print,Forum Auctions,
artsy-0000367.jpg,1973,Joan Brown,11-04-2023,Description,"Considered part of the second generation of the Bay Area Figurative movement, influential artist Joan Brown obsessively painted everyday imagery from her own life: domestic scenes, swimming excursions in the San Francisco bay, or outings to the opera with her husband. In a predominantly flat, decorative style, Brown painted figures and animals in fanciful scenarios; enamored with ancient Egyptian art and mythology, she would often paint silhouettes and human-animal hybrids such as the sphinx. Though she denied having any explicit feminist agenda, her subject matter aligned closely with the psychological imperatives of feminist art; her images displayed the artist’s introspective spiritual life.

The resulting sculptures are brought to life by the work of his chisel, creating gradations of highlights and shadows and lightly painted surfaces. Early examples of his work—male or female nudes attached to pedestals—echoed classical Greek statues; their carefully positioned features (the geometry of the lip, the curve of the eyebrow) and extraordinarily life-like relaxed postures belie their apparent simplicity. More recent works feature unremarkably dressed contemporary figures, rendered with enough detail to almost suggest three-dimensional portraiture. However, showing no signs of emotion and bearing no socio-critical references, they retain considerable banality. “I’m perhaps proposing a story and not telling the end, just giving a beginning or fragment.

David Yarrow is recognized as one of the world’s best-selling photographers. He has found his true comfort zone in capturing the animal and human world in a fresh and creative way. A key part of his success has been creating art through partnerships with a philanthropic objective and this has enabled him to work with leading figures in sports, fashion, and Hollywood, such as Cindy Crawford, Cara Delevingne, Ciara and Russell Wilson, and Alessandra Ambrosio. Since 2019, charitable donations from the sale of Yarrow’s images have exceeded $10 million.
Yarrow was born in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1966. He took up photography at an early age and as a 20-year-old found himself working as a photographer for The London Times on the pitch at the World Cup Final in Mexico City. On that day, David took the famous picture of Diego Maradona holding the World Cup and, as a result, was subsequently asked to cover the Olympics and numerous other sporting events. His distinctive work in recent years has earned him an ever-growing following amongst art collectors. Yarrow is now represented by some of the top contemporary galleries around the world.

One of his most famous works was a site-specific installation with pools of colored water suspended in vinyl tubes hanging from trees.

Ruff came to prominence as part of the Düsseldorf School, a loosely affiliated group of photographers who studied under Bernd and Hilla Becher.

Despite their extraordinary weight, Pepper’s curvilinear steel forms, such as Curved Presence (2012), often appear light and buoyant. After training at the Pratt Institute, Pepper began her career as a social realist painter; she transitioned to sculpture somewhat organically, carving her first pieces from trees fallen in her garden in Rome. She was asked to participate in the 1962 “Festival of Two Worlds” in Spoleto, Italy which included works by Alexander Calder and Henry Moore. To prepare for the exhibition, Pepper began working with metal and learned to weld in order to create Il Dono di Icaro (“The Gift of Icarus”) (1962)—an iron and steel sculpture that still stands in the Italian town. Her stainless steel sculptures with mirrored surfaces, such as Torre Pieno nel Vuoto (1968), connect to their environment by reflecting the surrounding landscape.

artsy-0000430.jpg,2012,Victor Castillo,11-04-2023,Description,"Painter Victor Castillo has been identified as a pop-surrealist for his distinguishable stylistic references to vintage comics, animation, and popular media. After experiencing disillusionment with his native Chile and studies in art school, Castillo developed his current style out of “frustration and anger,” and a dark sense of humor. His works spin ominous allegorical and political narratives of current world crises in post-apocalyptic settings; greed, chaos, brutality and destruction are frequent themes in his work. The protagonists of his paintings are frequently children with blank eyes—the artist’s metaphor for ignorance. Castillo admits that people might find his works “a little tenebrous or even satanic,” but explains that he is not a dark person, and is instead interested in creating accessible art. His work is also influenced by Spanish Old Master painters, particularly Francisco de Goya.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch10\artsy-0000430.jpg,Painting,Jonathan LeVine Projects,15000

As a student at the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology Onobrakpeya co-founded the Zaria Art Society, a group dedicated to developing a style of postcolonial Nigerian art that embraced Pan-African folklore, motifs, and iconography.

Katz developed his signature style as a reaction against the Abstract Expressionism that dominated the mid–20th century, when he began painting. Instead, he embraced narrative, figurative clarity and the accessible pleasures of Pop art, though he remains untethered to any particular school or movement. Katz studied at Cooper Union in New York and spent a summer learning plein air painting at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture before he began presenting regularly in New York and cities across the world. His work has been included in shows at institutions such as the Whitney Museum of American Art, the National Portrait Gallery in London, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and the Fosun Foundation in Shanghai, among others.

artsy-0000435.jpg,1985,Sol LeWitt,11-04-2023,Description,"Sol LeWitt famously stressed the importance of the ideas that animated his artwork over the particulars of their execution. A leading figure of the Conceptual and Minimalist movements, he maintained a practice that included drawing, printmaking, photography, painting, installation, sculpture, and writing. He is perhaps best known for simple, geometric drawings and wall paintings and for his “structures”: modular sculptures of cubed forms, variously constructed from steel, polyurethane, wood, or concrete. LeWitt also received attention for his writings on the nature of Conceptual art. To “install” his wall paintings, contemporary exhibition spaces must follow a set of instructions the artist left behind. LeWitt received his BFA from Syracuse University. After graduating, he took classes at the Cartoonists and Illustrators School (now the School of Visual Arts), worked as a graphic designer and, later, worked shifts at the Museum of Modern Art alongside artists such as Dan Flavin and Robert Mangold. His work has been exhibited in a number of institutions including the Museum of Modern Art, MoMA PS1, the Centre Pompidou, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and the Pérez Art Museum Miami; it also belongs in the collections of countless museums including the Tate, the Guggenheim Museum, Dia Beacon, and the Musée National d’Art Moderne in Paris.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch10\artsy-0000435.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Heritage Auctions,8000

Amalgamation (2018) reflects Sato’s use of expressive interiors and a harmonious color palette painted in a geometric style, revealing his interest in the design principles of the Old Masters. Born in Japan but raised in Tanzania, Sato was exposed to a broad spectrum of cultures, communities, and languages throughout his early life which has led to his desire to explore the influence of culture and class on the human condition throughout his work.

Urns are frequent motifs throughout Ai’s practice, which often comments on mass consumption, individuality, censorship, and interconnections among contemporary cultures. Ai studied at the Beijing Film Academy before attending Parsons School of Design, and he has exhibited in New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Copenhagen, Beijing, London, and other cities. His work belongs in the collections of multiple institutions, including Centre Pompidou, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Tate, among others.

Created with Maya, a 3-D modeling software that Caesar used to make digital animations for the film and television industry in the late 1990s, Caesar’s images are fantastic, glamorous caricatures that recall the paintings of John Currin and Lisa Yuskavage. “I take difficult memories and hidden emotions and turn them into something that at first glance seems pretty, then you notice something a little disturbing or an ingredient that you wonder why it might be there,” Caesar explains. “A little tainted, a little melancholy, a little funny, a little sad and a little taboo… I mix this with clocks and scissors and irons and knives and silk dresses hiding strange things un¬derneath.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch11\artsy-0000484.jpg,Mixed Media,Jonathan LeVine Projects,18000

While he would ultimately change his focus to painting, manmade structures became a central motif in his work throughout most of his career. Among his most iconic paintings are those featuring urban winter scenes, and New York City’s streets. Later in his life, Wiggins turned his attention to rendering delicate landscapes. He attended the National Academy of Design in New York, where his teachers included William Merritt Chase and Robert Henri. In the 1920s, he rallied with other young painters at the Connecticut Academy of Fine Arts to develop a uniquely American form of French Impressionism.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch11\artsy-0000493.jpg,Painting,Questroyal Fine Art,37500

He drew widely from popular culture and everyday subject matter in his most famous works: his 32 Campbell's soup cans, Brillo pad box sculptures, and portraits of Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, for example. Rejecting the dominant painting and sculpting modes of his day, Warhol embraced silk-screen printmaking to achieve his characteristic hard edges and flat areas of color. The artist mentored Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and continues to influence contemporary art around the world: His provocative successors include Richard Prince, Takashi Murakami, and Jeff Koons. Warhol has been the subject of exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern, and Centre Pompidou, among other institutions.

In the recent series “Roots,” Quaresma photographed areas of personal significance in Rio de Janeiro, and then painted geometric shapes and freeform lines overtop the images. According to Quaresma, making the series “was a process of rescuing my identity.” “In the studio space I worked over the images with geometrical lines and casual acrylic brush marks, creating a duality between documentary and imaginary.” Throughout Quaresma’s body of work, negotiations between the intimate and universal, personal and political, and physical and psychological are present and emphasized by her drawn interventions.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch11\artsy-0000499.jpg,Mixed Media,Patrick Heide Contemporary Art,

Entirely self-taught, REWA first grabbed attention with her 14-piece of body of work, “The Pantheon” (2016) which portrayed female African goddesses as beautiful, colorful, and inviting, with the intention of overturning what she saw as the West African tendency to denigrate and reject their own deities. She has since focused on female-centered narratives in order to explore aspects of Igbo culture. Onyinye (God’s Gift) (2020) painted in REWA’s trademark stained glass aesthetic is one in a series of portraits focusing on the significance of naming rites. REWA describes her paintings as Igbo Vernacular Art and considers them an original body of work that exists outside formal academic or Western characterization.

artsy-0000505.jpg,1951,Henri Laurens,11-04-2023,Description,"Henri Laurens began his career creating wood and polychrome plaster sculptures, drawing on the tenets of Cubism and adopting such typically Cubist subjects as dissected human figures, guitars, and still lifes. For instance, Clown (1915), which drew on Pablo Picassos’s assemblages, consists of juxtaposed spheres, cones, and cylinders. As his career progressed, Laurens shifted toward subtler low-relief terracottas, eventually forsaking his fragmented geometric style in favor of a more natural, curvilinear one. He became known for highly abstract, rhythmic female nudes, often reclining or bathing, made from stone or bronze. Works such as La Grande Sirène (1945) and Amphion (1952) reinterpret themes from Greco-Roman mythology; Laurens approached his sculptures with a vague notion of how they should look, but increasingly succumbed to subconscious inspiration. Besides sculpting, he was also prolific in collage, printmaking, and illustration.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch11\artsy-0000505.jpg,Books and Portfolios,Forum Auctions,

Using a technique of pouring diluted oil paint onto a canvas in layers, she sometimes experimented with variations of a single hue and at other times created a purposeful interplay of different tones, as in The Song of the Wind (1977). Baber referred to her attempts to relay feelings through color as a “color hunger,” and exploration of “the infinite range of possibilities.” A member of the cooperative March Gallery in downtown New York, where she held her first solo exhibition in 1958, Baber was married to noted Abstract Expressionist painter Paul Jenkins.

Cropsey was known for his autumnal landscapes and vivid colors. Many of these were made from drawings and sketches he made during his travels, replete with notes on color. After the Civil War, Cropsey also became interested in Luminism and watercolor. He believed the highest goal of art was to “portray God in nature,” and continued to work near the very end of his life.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch12\artsy-0000536.jpg,Painting,Questroyal Fine Art,135000

artsy-0000559.jpg,2021,Michael Geertsen,11-04-2023,Description,"In reference to historical epochs of art, design, and culture, Danish-born ceramist Michael Geertsen creates works that function as contemporary statements. During formal study at the Danish School of Design in Copenhagen in the late 1980s, Geertsen also apprenticed for a ceramist; it was within these years that he developed an extensive understanding of sculptural forms and traditional, wheel-based pottery practice. In Geertsen’s early work, basic geometric forms were thrown to his pottery wheel, producing sliced, rearranged, and staggered vessels, which were unified by a monochromatic glaze. Geertsen has also experimented with organic shapes and various patterned surfaces (from camouflage and animal skin to mirrored platinum) and expanded his oeuvre to wall hangings and architectural spaces. Despite the variations and modifications, Geertsen’s assemblages maintain a consistent motif—movement—depicted through the rhythm and repetition of his pulsating vessels.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch12\artsy-0000559.jpg,Design/Decorative Art,Køppe Contemporary Objects,7000

By shooting with Kodak Aerochrome—a discontinued infrared surveillance film that transforms greens into acid pinks and reds—Mosse has offered a searing, psychedelic vision of the warscape and its suffering inhabitants. In 2014, the series earned Mosse the prestigious Deutsche Börse Prize. The artist received his MFA in photography from Yale in 2008 and has since exhibited at The Bass, Foam Fotografiemuseum, and Tate Modern, among other institutions. In 2013, Mosse represented Ireland at the Venice Biennale.

His early bronze sculptures of anguished human figures incorporated impressions made by machines as well as found objects, synthesizing them to evoke new associations. This later developed into a new process of piecing together works from prefabricated aluminum and brass casting molds; the resulting geometric human forms have often been described as “totems for the technological age.” Crucially, Paolozzi came to embrace technology rather than perceiving it as a demon to be feared, and wrote and lectured extensively on how popular culture and science should inform sculpture.

artsy-0000572.jpg,2023,Audra Weaser,11-04-2023,Description,"The inspiration for Audra Weaser’s abstract landscapes comes from the Southern California terrain of her upbringing, particularly her memories of the transitions between mountains, ocean, and desert. Weaser studied abstract, non-objective painting, though her earliest works were sanded wall sculptures. Her best-known body of paintings borrows from both approaches. She begins each work by applying layers of color to wood panel, and then covers the surface in an overlay of white paint. Later, she sands away the layers—a process she calls “excavation”—to create compositions that resemble reflections of forests on water. Weaser explains: “The trees reflecting on a watery plain reveal a shimmering version rather than a solid fact. My paintings are a desire to . . . reconnect to the unseen as a resonating poetic experience.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch12\artsy-0000572.jpg,Painting,JoAnne Artman Gallery,28500

The gaze of Miller’s subjects in works such as Flowers on Her Shoulder (2020) or September (2019) is direct and confrontational, but also vulnerable, suggestive of great internal grief and self-reflection. In lieu of live models, Miller paints from a library of reference images, sometimes creating composite images from multiple sources and portraying faces which are utterly unique but who represent a shared universal experience. Working directly with her fingers instead of a brush, Miller paints on paper-covered canvas, applying layer after layer of acrylic paint and transparent glaze; this process imbues her images with textural depth and an aged quality reminiscent of Renaissance portraiture.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch13\artsy-0000577.jpg,Painting,GALLERI RAMFJORD,14000

His practice often comments on such issues as incarceration, immigrant rights, and poverty—yet JR infuses his work with joy and hope for change. He has exhibited in cities including New York, London, Paris, Tokyo, Berlin, and Seoul. JR’s work belongs in the collections of the Musée de l’Elysée, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Museum Frieder Burda.

He’s particularly renowned for his “outrenoir” (“beyond black”) series of paintings, which feature matte and glossy black fields interrupted by ridges, scores, and gashes; the artist is interested in how black paint absorbs and reflects light. Since making his gallery debut in 1947, Soulages has exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, the Louvre, and the State Hermitage Museum (he was the first living artist to show at the institution), and his work has been acquired for the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim, Tate Modern, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.

The artist stages precise renderings of wildlife—particularly birds of the northern hemisphere—against impressionistic landscape backgrounds defined by contrasting daubs of color.

His materials ranged from trash and earth to dust and stone, which created a sense of solidity and physicality throughout his oeuvre. Tàpies participated in the Venice Biennale four times and exhibited in cities including Paris, London, Barcelona, Brussels, Berlin, Tokyo, Zürich, and New York.

Her abstracted portraits display clear influences from cubism, expressionism, fauvism, and street art, while her use of color to deconstruct faces can be compared to works by Francis Bacon and Jenny Saville. Nielly studied at the École Superieure D’art & De Design Marseille-Méditerranée and worked in advertising and photography before becoming a painter.

He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky For the Love of God (2007), a human skull studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire. Since 1988, when the artist developed and curated “Freeze,” a groundbreaking exhibition of his work and that of his Goldsmiths College peers, he has been the subject of major shows at Tate Modern in London, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

The son of a naval officer, Slonem honed his craft at Tulane University in New Orleans and, later, at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, where he was exposed to artists including Alice Neel and Alex Katz. Today, his work sells for five figures on the secondary market and can be found in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Bahrain National Museum, and the Guilin Art Museum, among other institutions.

Her works characteristically feature chunky and exaggerated human proportions, strong contour lines, and minimal shading—a style influenced by both folk art and modernist painting.

He drew widely from popular culture and everyday subject matter in his most famous works: his 32 Campbell's soup cans, Brillo pad box sculptures, and portraits of Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, for example. Rejecting the dominant painting and sculpting modes of his day, Warhol embraced silk-screen printmaking to achieve his characteristic hard edges and flat areas of color. The artist mentored Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and continues to influence contemporary art around the world: His provocative successors include Richard Prince, Takashi Murakami, and Jeff Koons. Warhol has been the subject of exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern, and Centre Pompidou, among other institutions.

Kahn’s signature landscapes took inspiration from the palettes of Henri Matisse and the ethos of his Vermont farm: He painted weathered barns, undulating pastures, and tree lines that embraced a spare, evocative New England aesthetic. Kahn studied under Hans Hofmann and cited Mark Rothko, J.M.W. Turner, and Pierre Bonnard as additional influences.

artsy-0000745.jpg,1915,Alfred Kubin,11-04-2023,Description,"Alfred Kubin’s haunting illustrations, watercolors, and lithographs of symbol-laden fantasy worlds are said to have presaged the horrors of WWI. Death, parenthood, sexuality, the unconscious, and explicit and violent portrayals of women as femmes fatales are recurring motifs in his oeuvre. Originating in his own imagination and traumatic life experiences, the nightmarish imagery also stems from writings by Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Edgar Allen Poe, many of which Kubin illustrated. Stylistically linked with Symbolism and Expressionism and known for a delicate, atmospheric ink wash technique, Kubin was influenced by the macabre aquatints of Francisco de Goya, Odilon Redon, James Ensor, and Max Klinger. However, he shifted to producing frenetically rendered, reality-based drawings with watercolor accents, sparked by a realization that life’s mysteries “lie not only in the bizarre, exalted, or comic moments...but [also in] the painful, the indifferent, and the incidental commonplace.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch15\artsy-0000745.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Galerie St. Etienne,20500

Influenced by the first generation of Abstract Expressionists, he sought a style even further removed from mimesis and preoccupied entirely with surface, color, and medium. Beginning with drawing and a schema, he would build layers of abstraction to explore spirituality and eroticism through paint, altogether eschewing narrative content or figuration.

artsy-0000751.jpg,2019,Yukimasa Ida,11-04-2023,Description,"Submitted by Mariane Ibrahim Gallery.
Yukimasa Ida works between abstraction and realism to create paintings infused with nostalgia. His practice relies on the concept of “ICHI-GO ICHI-E (a once in a lifetime moment).” His specific approach of distorting figuration creates a formal ambiguity and a conceptual singularity. His paintings are done in accordance with the rules of shape and color theory. The paint hangs from the canvas with a thickness that invites the viewer to take a closer look, while the exorbitant complimentary colors mix to project subversive futuristic and wistful moments. At the same time, the artist’s gesture is deeply impregnated of the “ICHI-GO ICHI-E” cultural concept that leads him questioning the subtleties of existence. After visualizing the “now” which won’t happen again, he projects this present moment on the canvas thus conferring to each of his paintings a very unique dimension.
Yukimasa Ida graduated in 2019 with a Masters in Oil Painting from Tokyo University of the Arts. He has exhibited across Japan, and abroad in Europe at spaces including Fabien Fryns Fine Art (London, U.K.), and Kaikai Kiki Gallery (Tokyo, Japan). Ida won the CAF Special Jury Award (2016), and the Arts in Marunouchi Grand Prix (2015).",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch15\artsy-0000751.jpg,Painting,Masters & Contemporary,

He studied at the Croydon School of Art, where he became interested in the Situationists and met Malcolm McLaren, who would later become the Sex Pistols’ manager.

Trained in commercial art and graphic design before turning to painting full time, Iturria is a prolific artist. He is generous with oil paint, building up lush textures on surfaces ranging from traditional (canvas) to unconventional (corrugated cardboard). His palette is dominated by muddy browns and earth tones that reflect the colors of the Plate River and the southern Atlantic Ocean, which formed the backdrop to his childhood in Montevideo. He merges representation and surrealism in his compositions, concentrating on the domestic details and spaces of his childhood and of urban living.

Maar had an active and respected career as an avant-garde photographer and Surrealist artist. A prominent member of the Parisian avant-garde, her friends and lovers included Georges Bataille, Yves Tanguy, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and André Breton. Maar had originally studied painting but turned to photography after modeling for Man Ray’s photographs. She produced portraits, nudes, landscapes, fashion photographs, and photomontages. Her montages frequently featured strong architectural elements and narratives. Among Surrealist circles, she was applauded for her understanding of the movement’s emphasis on naturalism; Maar also wrote poetry.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch16\artsy-0000770.jpg,Photography,LUNN Ltd.,2500

Throughout his life, Kokoschka was concerned with expressing human character and psychology through effects of color, formal distortion, and violent brushwork. Like Max Beckmann, he is considered a founding leader of Expressionism, but both artists maintained some independence from the movement; Kokoschka rejected the term as a description of his work and maintained that his practice adhered to traditional themes and values. He is most celebrated for his dark, emotionally turbulent figurative paintings, like The Bride of the Wind (1914), a meditation on his affair with Alma Mahler.

Using formal, centralized groupings of objects, blank backgrounds, and eye-level perspective, Stott’s approach to composition is minimalist, emphasizing the basic geometric forms which serve as the foundation of many vintage designs. The mundane objects which populate Stott’s paintings, such as rotary telephones, wind-up alarm clocks, manual typewriters, and 35mm cameras, are suggestive of larger ideas such as communication, the passage of time, storytelling, and image-making. By depicting functional objects which are all slightly out of date, Stott also incites nostalgia, inviting viewers to pause for a moment and contemplate the stories that obsolete objects can tell us about our collective histories.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch16\artsy-0000779.jpg,Painting,Billis Williams Gallery,5800

The gaze of Miller’s subjects in works such as Flowers on Her Shoulder (2020) or September (2019) is direct and confrontational, but also vulnerable, suggestive of great internal grief and self-reflection. In lieu of live models, Miller paints from a library of reference images, sometimes creating composite images from multiple sources and portraying faces which are utterly unique but who represent a shared universal experience.

Beard imbues his artistic alter egos with complex biographies and individual styles, a conceit that allows him to explore the styles of German Expressionism, Impressionism, Postmodernism, and other genres. His most recognized persona is that of Bruce Sargeant, a fictional 20th-century British painter whose homoerotic works celebrated an idolized male physique. Named after John Singer Sargent, Beard’s character was created as a way to insert an explicitly queer agenda into the (predominantly heteronormative or closeted) art historical canon. At times his works are controversial, as in the case of his Basquiat-like persona Peter Coulter, which has drawn criticism for its use of blackface. Beard’s paintings, prints, and sculptural works are included in the MoMA and Whitney Museum collections as well as at Harvard and Yale universities.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch17\artsy-0000833.jpg,Painting,CLAMP,9500

Stock’s work skillfully employs color, shadow, and line to create brooding effects of mood and tension, while subtly using facial expression, body language, and background to reveal compelling narrative elements. Filled with images of clandestine trysts, voyeuristic impulses, illicit affairs, and unrequited love, Stock’s work is unapologetically melodramatic, evoking a world of frustrated desire and ultimate loneliness, albeit one colored by the artist’s darkly acerbic sense of humor. Beginning his career as a lithographer, Stock made prints for artists such as Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, David Hockney, and Roy Lichtenstein before turning to painting.

He found mentors in Mark Rothko and Franz Kline. In the late 1960s, Held began to challenge the flatness of many modernist painting styles, breaking up the picture plane with suggestions of deep space and three-dimensional form. He worked exclusively in black and white for nearly a decade before reintroducing eye-popping color into his canvases.

These themes can be seen in Nature Lover (ca. 2020), with a bicycle in silhouette combined with a burst of brightly colored butterflies that surround and follow the rider.

Baber referred to her attempts to relay feelings through color as a “color hunger,” and exploration of “the infinite range of possibilities.” A member of the cooperative March Gallery in downtown New York, where she held her first solo exhibition in 1958, Baber was married to noted Abstract Expressionist painter Paul Jenkins.

Rose’s material of choice lends her figures a sense of vulnerability and delicacy, also expressed in their meditative facial expressions and postures, and graceful, elongated limbs. The fragility of porcelain belies its sturdiness, a paradox that imbues her figures with a sense of strength. She situates them amidst rustic found objects, such as tree branches, or in wooden boats or atop wooden horses, animating them and suggesting a sense of narrative or psychological presence.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch17\artsy-0000883.jpg,Sculpture,Sue Greenwood Fine Art,4000

Beard imbues his artistic alter egos with complex biographies and individual styles, a conceit that allows him to explore the styles of German Expressionism, Impressionism, Postmodernism, and other genres. His most recognized persona is that of Bruce Sargeant, a fictional 20th-century British painter whose homoerotic works celebrated an idolized male physique. Named after John Singer Sargent, Beard’s character was created as a way to insert an explicitly queer agenda into the (predominantly heteronormative or closeted) art historical canon. At times his works are controversial, as in the case of his Basquiat-like persona Peter Coulter, which has drawn criticism for its use of blackface. Beard’s paintings, prints, and sculptural works are included in the MoMA and Whitney Museum collections as well as at Harvard and Yale universities.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch17\artsy-0000888.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",CLAMP,1000

Kounellis’s practice spanned sculpture, performance, installation, and painting, and his disparate media included cotton, soil, coal, burlap sacks, glass bottles, meat hooks, fire, soot, bed frames, instruments, clothing, and more. Early in his career, Kounellis took inspiration from artists including Alberto Burri, Lucio Fontana, Jackson Pollock, and Franz Kline—experimental painters who pushed the boundaries of their own medium. Indeed, even as his work grew less painterly, Kounellis insisted he was a painter above all else. He has been the subject of retrospectives at the Whitechapel Gallery, the Museo Reina Sofía, the Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Moderna in Rome, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, among other institutions.

Dalí’s fantastical prints, paintings, sculptures, films, and writing helped cement the movement’s identity. Working off psychoanalytic ideas, Dalí rendered fantastical creatures and landscapes that could unsettle and awe. His 1931 canvas The Persistence of Memory is one of the most recognizable artworks of all time.

Fosso began taking photographs at age thirteen after fleeing the civil war in Nigeria. After settling in the Central African Republic, he made a living taking wedding portraits and passport pictures, and began using the leftover frames to take self-portraits, at first to send to his grandmother in Nigeria. ""I wanted to show how good I look,” Fosso has noted about these early pictures, referencing his practice of dressing up in bell bottoms, disco boots, hotpants, and other costume attire for his self-portraits. More recently, in his series “African Spirits” (2008), Fosso has continued to transform his appearance by posing as fourteen iconic figures of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, casting himself as Angela Davis, Malcolm X, and Muhammad Ali, among others.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch17\artsy-0000898.jpg,Photography,Christophe Person,

He briefly worked in a Cubist mode and helped spur movements including Dada and Conceptualism. Though his practice spanned drawing, painting, and installation, Duchamp is perhaps most famous for his “readymade” sculptures: pieces composed of prefabricated objects such as a urinal, a shovel, or a bicycle wheel affixed to a wooden stool, which the artist situated in the middle of the exhibition space. Duchamp saw the readymade as an opportunity to free art from traditional confines of taste and beauty. He studied at Académie Julian before becoming involved in the avant-garde circles of New York and Paris. Duchamp also played tournament chess and, in the last decades of his life, worked in secret on a final installation, Étant donnés (1946–66). His pieces have sold for up to eight figures on the secondary market and belong in the collections of countless institutions, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, the Staatliches Museum Schwerin, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch18\artsy-0000913.jpg,Other,Larkin Erdmann,7000

Vostell has exhibited widely around the world and participated in the sixth edition of Documenta in 1977. Working amid the rise of performance-based art in postwar Germany, he was a pioneer of conceptual art and a leading German proponent of Happenings and _Dé-coll/age_—an expansion of collage that included events, installations, images, and destructive processes meant to tear down outworn customs and values. Much of Vostell’s work incorporates two of the most salient symbols of postwar consumer culture: the television and the automobile. He is also known for embedding objects in concrete, as in his 1970 work Concrete Traffic, a durational sculpture in which he encased a 1957 Cadillac DeVille in the material.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch18\artsy-0000916.jpg,Mixed Media,Galerie aKonzept,

His childhood trips to Italy, where he was exposed to the Old Masters and the country’s rich artistic heritage, sparked his interest in art. He initially studied watercolor painting and later switched to oils, teaching himself how to work with the latter material. He concentrates on urban and natural landscapes and the human figure, rendering his subjects in a naturalistic, impressionistic style. Lorusso is especially interested in painting ordinary people in everyday settings, which he invests with a sense of pathos and mystery. Through his work, he aims to connect to others by conveying universal human experiences. “I believe truly great art serves as a trigger into something deeper within all of us,” he says.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch19\artsy-0000953.jpg,Painting,Bonner David Galleries,2500

Initially inspired by quilt patterns, Delaunay eventually incorporated the stylistic concerns of Cubism, Fauvism, and Futurism into her bright, geometric paintings and prints. She variously dubbed her style “Orphism” or “Simultaneism” and focused on the possibilities of color combinations. In 1964, Delaunay became the first living female artist to have a retrospective exhibition at the Louvre; her work would later be shown at institutions including the Musée d’Art Moderne de Paris, the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, the Centre Pompidou, Tate Modern, and Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.

Working with pencil, ink, ballpoint pen, crayon, and paint on paper, he makes abstract drawings that vary from spare to maximalist. For some of his largest compositions, he uses only a ballpoint pen, working line-by-line to build up forms that sweep across the page and resemble the undulating, striated surfaces of rock formations. By contrast, some of his smaller works feature only a handful of marks, which float delicately in the center of an otherwise blank page. Describing his practice, Müller has said, “Attraction and repulsion, breathing in and breathing out, vigor and laxity are poles between which my work oscillates. . . . My work generates its energy and vitality precisely from these polarities and tensions.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch19\artsy-0000967.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Kristof De Clercq gallery,

Early examples of his work—male or female nudes attached to pedestals—echoed classical Greek statues; their carefully positioned features (the geometry of the lip, the curve of the eyebrow) and extraordinarily life-like relaxed postures belie their apparent simplicity. More recent works feature unremarkably dressed contemporary figures, rendered with enough detail to almost suggest three-dimensional portraiture. However, showing no signs of emotion and bearing no socio-critical references, they retain considerable banality. “I’m perhaps proposing a story and not telling the end, just giving a beginning or fragment.

artsy-0000976.jpg,2007,Damien Hirst,11-04-2023,Description,"Damien Hirst, a poster boy for the Young British Artists who rose to prominence in late 1980s London, is one of the most notorious artists of his generation. He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky For the Love of God (2007), a human skull studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire. Since 1988, when the artist developed and curated “Freeze,” a groundbreaking exhibition of his work and that of his Goldsmiths College peers, he has been the subject of major shows at Tate Modern in London, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In 2008, Hirst controversially staged “Beautiful Inside my Head Forever,” an auction in which he sold his work directly to the public and raked in around $200 million for himself.

Beard imbues his artistic alter egos with complex biographies and individual styles, a conceit that allows him to explore the styles of German Expressionism, Impressionism, Postmodernism, and other genres. His most recognized persona is that of Bruce Sargeant, a fictional 20th-century British painter whose homoerotic works celebrated an idolized male physique. Named after John Singer Sargent, Beard’s character was created as a way to insert an explicitly queer agenda into the (predominantly heteronormative or closeted) art historical canon. At times his works are controversial, as in the case of his Basquiat-like persona Peter Coulter, which has drawn criticism for its use of blackface. Beard’s paintings, prints, and sculptural works are included in the MoMA and Whitney Museum collections as well as at Harvard and Yale universities.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch19\artsy-0000977.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",CLAMP,1000

Cotton paints from life, constructing elaborate models using real baked goods and other confectionery, from which he derives the fantastical environments depicted in his large-scale canvases. Cotton’s work has been interpreted as a criticism of the greed and the overindulgence of American society, as well as a contemporary re-imagination of traditional genres such as landscape and portraiture. Cotton has also directed his creative energies toward the realm of popular culture, acting as art director for Katy Perry’s California Gurls (2010) music video and depicting the singer in a series of paintings.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch19\artsy-0000978.jpg,Print,Pace Prints,20000

Baseball players, trains, crashing waves, political figures, and comic book characters make frequent appearances, often accompanied by cryptic, ironic snippets of handwritten text. Pettibon has been the subject of solo shows at the New Museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, and the Kunsthalle Wien. He has exhibited at the Venice Biennale, Documenta, and the Whitney Biennial, where he was the recipient of the Bucksbaum Award in 2004.

Calder was an international phenomenon during his lifetime. He won the grand prize for sculpture at the 1952 Venice Biennale, where he represented the United States. He earned the French Legion of Honor and the American Presidential Medal of Freedom, among other honors. Calder has been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, the Rijksmuseum, the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, and the Museo Reina Sofía.

""I wanted to show how good I look,” Fosso has noted about these early pictures, referencing his practice of dressing up in bell bottoms, disco boots, hotpants, and other costume attire for his self-portraits.

Haring united the appeal of cartoons with the raw energy of Art Brut artists such as Jean DuBuffet as he developed a distinct pop-graffiti aesthetic that comprised energetic, boldly outlined figures against solid or patterned backdrops. His major themes included exploitation, subjugation, drug abuse, and the threat of nuclear holocaust; Haring boldly engaged with social issues, especially after receiving an AIDS diagnosis in 1987.

Along with Joan Miró, he explored automatic drawing, seeking to express the creative force of the unconscious. This led to images—like the celebrated Battle of the Fishes (1927), a poetic depiction of conflict and metamorphosis with undertones of primordial eroticism—derived from random gestures and drawn spontaneously in glue, then sprinkled with colored sands for added texture and complexity. His signature violence, evident in the terrifying, fragmented figures of In The Tower of Sleep (1938), reflects the horrors of the Spanish Civil War and WWII, as well as his own troubled psyche in the aftermath of his service in WWI.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch19\artsy-0001033.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Riva Advisory,

Jerkface received his artistic training through New York’s street art scene, and his flattened figuration and bright color palettes reflect this influence. Though the artist first found success on the East Coast, his practice has expanded both geographically and artistically. Jerkface murals now adorn cities around the world, and he has exhibited paintings in Hong Kong, New York, and beyond.

His flat, graphic, and at times geometric compositions straddle the line between representation and abstraction; they have referenced floral arrangements, hospital doors, and human figures ranging from celebrities to friends and family. Hume draws on both found images and his own memories as he explores beauty, pleasure, melancholy, and loss. The artist has exhibited at the Venice Biennale and the São Paulo Bienal. In 1996, he was shortlisted for the Turner Prize. Hume has been the subject of solo shows at Tate Britain, the Whitechapel Gallery, Modern Art Oxford, the Kestner Gesellschaft, Kunsthaus Bregenz, and the Irish Museum of Modern Art.

To make his series “Rauchbilder” (German for “smoke pictures”), he applied solvent to pigmented paper and lit it on fire, developing images in the residual soot. Piene also built large-scale public projects that he called “Sky Art”; some incorporated helium-filled sculptures. In his “Light Ballets,” he projected light through perforated globes, columns, and other materials. For nearly 20 years, Piene served as the director of the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 2008, he co-founded the International ZERO Foundation with Heinz Mack and Günther Uecker to archive documents, projects, and images produced by Group Zero.

artsy-0001071.jpg,2021,Hunter Potter,11-04-2023,Description,"Hunter Potter uses a bold color palette and whimsical, geometric figures inspired by American folklore to create poppy paintings that celebrate the minutiae of daily life on a monumental scale. Potter’s characters often draw on subjects on the fringe of society; the cowboy is a recurring motif, perhaps questioning what it means to be a man in contemporary American society. More often than not, as in Not A Care In The World (2020), these paintings simply encourage the viewer to stop and appreciate the here and now. Potter’s figures often feature society’s underdogs; the criminals, fighters, and runaways he associates his work with are similar to characters in novels by John Steinbeck, Ernest Hemingway, and Wallace Stegner, whose writing influences Potter’s work. Although he continues to create more intimate work, the artist’s enthusiasm for large scale works began when he was apprenticed to paint billboards in New York. Potter was the recipient of the Roger Smith Artist Fellowship at the Vermont Studio Center in 2018 and was awarded residencies in London at the Plop Residency and The Fores Project.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch21\artsy-0001071.jpg,Painting,3 White Dots,10000

He drew widely from popular culture and everyday subject matter in his most famous works: his 32 Campbell's soup cans, Brillo pad box sculptures, and portraits of Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, for example. Rejecting the dominant painting and sculpting modes of his day, Warhol embraced silk-screen printmaking to achieve his characteristic hard edges and flat areas of color. The artist mentored Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and continues to influence contemporary art around the world: His provocative successors include Richard Prince, Takashi Murakami, and Jeff Koons. Warhol has been the subject of exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern, and Centre Pompidou, among other institutions.

His work is informed by his own experience moving from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Cape Town, South Africa. Working primarily with oil paint, Luzumba frequently depicts his figures participating in leisurely activities, like playing chess or sharing a drink. The men in his paintings are often dressed in suits, a nod to the DRC’s reversal of a ban on Western attire, and the sense of freedom that accompanies the use of fashion to express defiance. In ELEGANCE (who is following who?) (2021) three well-dressed figures adorned in Oxford shirts and loafers walk as though they are floating against a deep green background; this painting’s air of normalcy contrasts with works such as Gold Digger (2019), which are more overtly critical of corruption.

The artist places his pictures in custom frames that feature borders inset with commercial goods such as cans of tomato sauce or motor oil. Thanks to his expansive approach to medium and inventive juxtapositions of North African culture and Western iconography, Hajjaj has garnered comparisons to iconoclasts and Pop phenoms such as Andy Warhol. He has exhibited in New York, London, Paris, Marrakesh, Dubai, Berlin, and Los Angeles.

By shooting with Kodak Aerochrome—a discontinued infrared surveillance film that transforms greens into acid pinks and reds—Mosse has offered a searing, psychedelic vision of the warscape and its suffering inhabitants. In 2014, the series earned Mosse the prestigious Deutsche Börse Prize. The artist received his MFA in photography from Yale in 2008 and has since exhibited at The Bass, Foam Fotografiemuseum, and Tate Modern, among other institutions.

Cotton paints from life, constructing elaborate models using real baked goods and other confectionery, from which he derives the fantastical environments depicted in his large-scale canvases. Cotton’s work has been interpreted as a criticism of the greed and the overindulgence of American society, as well as a contemporary re-imagination of traditional genres such as landscape and portraiture.

Inspired by African and Iberian art, he also contributed to the rise of Surrealism and Expressionism. Picasso’s sizable oeuvre grew to include over 20,000 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures, ceramics, theater sets, and costume designs. He painted his most famous work, Guernica (1937), in response to the Spanish Civil War; the totemic grisaille canvas remains a definitive work of anti-war art.

He drew widely from popular culture and everyday subject matter in his most famous works: his 32 Campbell's soup cans, Brillo pad box sculptures, and portraits of Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, for example. Rejecting the dominant painting and sculpting modes of his day, Warhol embraced silk-screen printmaking to achieve his characteristic hard edges and flat areas of color. The artist mentored Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and continues to influence contemporary art around the world: His provocative successors include Richard Prince, Takashi Murakami, and Jeff Koons.

De Blauwer studied fashion design at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp. She created her first collages as mood boards for her fashion collections; although she eventually left the field, she remained drawn to the process of combining disparate images to create cinematic narratives. Centering on anonymous female figures, De Blauwer’s collages critique the stereotypical depictions of women in media and reveal her own complex feelings surrounding identity, sexuality, and the female body.

artsy-0001154.jpg,1961,Marcello Mariani,11-04-2023,Description,"Born in Italy in 1938, painter Marcello Mariani was greatly influenced by New York City’s booming Post-War art scene, which notably included the Abstract Expressionists. Mariani also took on a great deal of inspiration from European artists like Piet Mondrian, Josef Albers and Hans Hofmann, whose work, which often focused on theories regarding the relationship between colors, are a clear influence for Mariani. In the ‘60s, Robert Rauschenberg—who was spending time in Rome—helped form Mariani’s ideas surrounding the potential of abstraction, and a 1974 collaboration with the artist Joseph Beuys pushed the conceptual rigor of his work. Studio Mariani Gallery in L'aquila, Italy—about 75 miles east of Rome—is an art space designed by Mariani which began unofficially in the ‘70s and ‘80s when Mariani would reserve space in his studio to display the work of his friends and fellow artists.

Throughout his career he has continuously adopted new materials and techniques to push the boundaries of his practice. In the 1960s, inspired by Gutai founder Jirō Yoshihara’s principle of doing what has never been done before, Matsutani began using blown air and vinyl glue —then a newly developed material —to create bulbous, sensual reliefs on canvas.

Harris’s tongue-in-cheek series of female nudes wearing only mid-century aprons and carrying tools allude to Renaissance-era depictions of the female form. Her still lifes invoke a similar humor as in the painting Damn Pajamas (2018), which portrays tattered books with fake titles such as, “Lose Weight, GET RICH, Find LOVE, LEARN A Second Language, KNIT Your Own Damn Pajamas...” and “Excelling at Things: People Expect You to Do This.” She applies thin layers of oil paint to create her lustrous hyperrealistic images.

Procktor studied painting at the Slade School of Fine Art under Keith Vaughan and William Coldstream, and later had a breakthrough first exhibition at London’s Redfern Gallery in 1963, which famously sold out before opening. The following year, Procktor participated in the “New Generation” show at Whitechapel Gallery alongside Bridget Riley, John Hoyland, and Hockney. Procktor’s use of the out-of-vogue medium of watercolor likely contributed to his lack of commercial success in later years, and his oil and acrylic paintings tend to be more sought after, such as Still life with flowers in a jug, on a table top which sold at a 2021 auction for £43,750.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch22\artsy-0001193.jpg,Print,Forum Auctions,

While his contemporaries practiced traditional lettering, Futura combined text, imagery, thin aerosol lines, swaths of vibrant color, and a distinctive use of white space as he created dynamic, futuristic compositions; science fiction and computing technology have long informed his aesthetic. In the 1980s—alongside fellow artists Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Kenny Scharf—Futura began exhibiting works on canvas in fine art gallery settings. In the ensuing decades, he’s exhibited at such institutions as the New Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and his work has sold for six figures at auction.

These paintings are based on photographs taken by the artist, who explained he was drawn to subjects who appeared out of place, alienated, or awkward. In the more recent paintings from the series, Amory began to eliminate parts of the architecture or scenery to heighten the sense of isolation. He paints in a realist style characterized by gestural brushwork and the use of translucent layers of paint for a hazy effect; his palette is muted and tends towards contrasts of dark and light. While his influences vary, Amory has said that the New Topographics have been an influence, for their similar pursuit of capturing beauty in the everyday and overlooked.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch22\artsy-0001196.jpg,Painting,Jonathan LeVine Projects,9500

The artist’s bold, calligraphic, non-objective canvases evolved from an interest in rational, mathematical-based approaches to artmaking. He later shifted his approach, embracing materiality and spontaneity as he used fast-drying paints and novel application methods such as rakes and olive branches to create his explosive compositions.

In lush, somewhat satirical still lives and landscapes that employ traditional painting styles and photographic techniques, Jacobsen offers a bucolic, sublime escape from contemporary consumerism, industry, and innovation. To enhance the transporting quality of his work, Jacobsen situates his two-dimensional works in environments that incorporate sculpture and installation.

His colorful, cartoonish characters—always rendered in profile, with one bold eye looking out at the viewer—lent a vibrant, human element to the stark symbol of division. Today, segments of Noir’s Berlin Wall murals belong to art collections around the world. The French-born, Berlin-based artist has expanded his practice to include painting, printmaking, and public art.

His primarily pastel palette and rough geometric compositions lend his paintings a near-mystical quality, while the tactile masses of paint applied as top layers possess an undeniable materiality. With flat underlayers that often appear to have been produced through the scraping away of paint, the works' tension lies in their contrast of surfaces: smooth is juxtaposed with rough, addition with subtraction.

artsy-0001217.jpg,2023,Nick Doyle,11-04-2023,Description,"Nick Doyle is keenly aware of the legacy of the American notion of Manifest Destiny. Known best for sculptural wall works made from collaged denim, Doyle infiltrates the vocabulary of Americana to examine greed, excess, and toxic masculinity. Doyle uses the road trip—a pillar of American mythology—as a point of entry to his work in order to question the persistence of rugged individualism as the fabric of our national identity. Through a series of mechanical miniatures, theatrical scenery, and satirical, prop-like denim works, the artist foregrounds the dangers of nostalgia and our evolving relationship to consumerism. Seemingly innocuous, Doyle’s imagery (vending machine, typewriter, cigarette pack) and materials (indigo and cotton) tell a story of American colonialism and consumerism, and explore the influence of media on global trade systems. By employing materials that hold cultural significance, the artist both reflects on and critiques social and political agendas that are often at play in contemporary life and visual culture.

Woodman’s compositions, aided by her long exposures, offer ghostly meditations on sexuality, identity, and the construction of the self. Woodman studied at the Rhode Island School of Design, where she developed her practice as she took inspiration from Surrealist photographers such as Man Ray and Claude Cahun. She did not exhibit widely before her untimely death at age 22, but her work has since been shown in New York, Zürich, Berlin, Rome, Paris, and London, and has been included in institutional shows at the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson, the Vertical Gallery of the Verbund Collection, the Guggenheim Museum, and Tate Modern, among others.

Recalling formal photographic portraiture of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, the realism of Louie’s meticulously detailed acrylic paintings contrasts sharply with the fantastic nature of his subjects. Influenced by German Expressionist cinema, film noir, Gothic literature, 1950s Sci-Fi, and the Weird Tales of H.P. Lovecraft, Louie’s work conjures up a black-and-white world of shadowy imagination, hinting at narratives and personal histories just beyond our reach. Louie’s portraits also touch on xenophobia and prejudice towards immigrants and other marginalized groups as he grapples with issues of identity.

His works are a combination of chaos and harmony, which, for him, reflects the balance of nature. Though their rectangular shape resembles that of traditional Chinese scroll paintings, Yinghua’s canvases are radically contemporary and subversive. To make his works, he stretches, welds, and sculpts precious metals, like pure silver, into crinkly forms, which he then affixes to the canvas in interlocking accretions, together with masses of trash. Splashes, strokes, and drips of paint complete these paradoxical pictures, through which he breaks down the distinction between trash and treasure, challenging viewers to re-assess conceptions of value and preciousness.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch26\artsy-0001297.jpg,Painting,Kristy Stubbs Gallery,35000

Ivan Arlaud’s paintings evoke the happiness of life though the warmhearted and sunny atmosphere found through his various interior scenes. Though the human figure is absent, the scenes do not lack intimacy, thanks to subtle clues, like a steaming cup of coffee, barely eaten fruit, or a book of poetry laid carelessly on an unfolded tablecloth. The painter offers us an invitation to leisure or a seat at a table. He sets the scene and leaves it to us to imagine its narrative. These interiors recall the comfort of one’s home. Through warm and vivid colors, Arlaud shows a mastery of his palette, juxtaposing shades in order to form luminous oppositions. Arlaud chooses his subjects from his daily life.

artsy-0001309.jpg,2015,Brett Amory,11-04-2023,Description,"Brett Amory gained broad recognition for his ongoing series “Waiting” (2001–), depicting anonymous commuters he encountered in urban settings; it was lauded for its psychological depth and representations of alienation in contemporary society. These paintings are based on photographs taken by the artist, who explained he was drawn to subjects who appeared out of place, alienated, or awkward. In the more recent paintings from the series, Amory began to eliminate parts of the architecture or scenery to heighten the sense of isolation. He paints in a realist style characterized by gestural brushwork and the use of translucent layers of paint for a hazy effect; his palette is muted and tends towards contrasts of dark and light. While his influences vary, Amory has said that the New Topographics have been an influence, for their similar pursuit of capturing beauty in the everyday and overlooked.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch26\artsy-0001309.jpg,Painting,Jonathan LeVine Projects,22000
artsy-0001310.jpg,1999,Margaret Kilgallen,11-04-2023,Description,"Inspired by vernacular folk art and local shop signs around San Francisco, Margaret Kilgallen combined elements of graffiti and sign painting to create graphic hand-painted murals. After receiving her bachelor’s degree in printmaking from Colorado College in 1989, Kilgallen moved to the Bay Area, where she became involved in the art scene of San Francisco’s Mission District. She and her husband, fellow artist Barry McGee, painted graffiti together, tagging freight trains with their monikers Matokie Slaughter and Twist. As a bookbinder and conservator for the San Francisco Public Library, Kilgallen amassed a vast knowledge of typography, which she applied her own practice that featured meticulously hand-crafted lettering. Using a distinct palette of red, yellow, and brown paint—often in discontinued or deeply discounted colors—she produced room-sized murals featuring women surfing or biking interspersed with text in circus-like fonts. At the time of her death from breast cancer at age 33, Kilgallen had recently received her MFA from Stanford.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch26\artsy-0001310.jpg,Print,Galeria Jordi Barnadas,

The gaze of Miller’s subjects in works such as Flowers on Her Shoulder (2020) or September (2019) is direct and confrontational, but also vulnerable, suggestive of great internal grief and self-reflection. In lieu of live models, Miller paints from a library of reference images, sometimes creating composite images from multiple sources and portraying faces which are utterly unique but who represent a shared universal experience. Working directly with her fingers instead of a brush, Miller paints on paper-covered canvas, applying layer after layer of acrylic paint and transparent glaze; this process imbues her images with textural depth and an aged quality reminiscent of Renaissance portraiture.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch27\artsy-0001322.jpg,Painting,Hashimoto Contemporary,2000

Beginning in the mid-1920s, Benton rendered elongated forms in both vibrant palettes and striking monochrome, depicting the realities of rural life and the pressures of industrialization. His canvases often feature symbols of progress such as railroads and factories, perhaps commenting on the tensions between industrialization and agricultural labor in early 20th-century American life. Benton’s work has sold for seven figures at auction and belongs in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among others.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch27\artsy-0001326.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Alessandro Berni Gallery,10500
artsy-0001327.jpg,1960,Emilio Vedova,11-04-2023,Description,"Considered one of the most influential Italian artists of the post-war period, Emilio Vedova is renowned for his expressive and gestural abstract paintings which seem to directly respond to the tumultuous political climate of his time. Politically engaged from an early age, he joined the Milanese anti-Fascist artists’ association known as Corrente, in 1942, and co-signed the Oltre Guernica (“Beyond Guernica”) manifesto in 1946, which encouraged artists to use abstraction rather than figuration to reflect the reality of contemporary society. In works such as Del nostro tempo (1960) and Studio per sopraffazione n. 1 (1962), Vedova’s bold, gestural brushstrokes and violent smears of paint vividly convey the sense of uncertainty, unease, and rebellion which characterized the 1960s. Vedova remained restlessly inventive throughout his career: He designed stage sets and costumes for opera, immersive light collages, monotypes, and large-scale glass engravings, as well as numerous examples of his _Plurimi_—freestanding, multi-panelled painted sculptures made of wood and metal.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch27\artsy-0001327.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Koos Gallery,

Weaser studied abstract, non-objective painting, though her earliest works were sanded wall sculptures. Her best-known body of paintings borrows from both approaches. She begins each work by applying layers of color to wood panel, and then covers the surface in an overlay of white paint. Later, she sands away the layers—a process she calls “excavation”—to create compositions that resemble reflections of forests on water. Weaser explains: “The trees reflecting on a watery plain reveal a shimmering version rather than a solid fact.

Fiercely committed to the avant-garde, Bolotowsky joined The Ten, a band of nine artists including Adolph Gottlieb and Mark Rothko that advocated for new forms of abstraction.

In the ongoing “The Malediction of Cham” series, Plaisir draws on the Curse of Cham, or Ham, a misinterpretation of a biblical story that has been used to justify racism. Paying homage to Black activists like Nina Simone, James Baldwin, and Aretha Franklin, Plaisir portrays the celebrities against a black background; she uses a unique shade created by Plaisr from multiple elements within her palette in order to emphasize the beauty and diversity of the color. The subjects, surrounded by organic and floral motifs drawn from Plaisir’s Caribbean heritage, exemplify the vision of an oppressionless utopia. Plaisir frequently highlights links between Black U.S. and Caribbean history in the fight for equality within her work.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch27\artsy-0001369.jpg,Painting,Chilli Art Projects,

artsy-0001371.jpg,1960,Emilio Vedova,11-04-2023,Description,"Considered one of the most influential Italian artists of the post-war period, Emilio Vedova is renowned for his expressive and gestural abstract paintings which seem to directly respond to the tumultuous political climate of his time. Politically engaged from an early age, he joined the Milanese anti-Fascist artists’ association known as Corrente, in 1942, and co-signed the Oltre Guernica (“Beyond Guernica”) manifesto in 1946, which encouraged artists to use abstraction rather than figuration to reflect the reality of contemporary society. In works such as Del nostro tempo (1960) and Studio per sopraffazione n. 1 (1962), Vedova’s bold, gestural brushstrokes and violent smears of paint vividly convey the sense of uncertainty, unease, and rebellion which characterized the 1960s. Vedova remained restlessly inventive throughout his career: He designed stage sets and costumes for opera, immersive light collages, monotypes, and large-scale glass engravings, as well as numerous examples of his _Plurimi_—freestanding, multi-panelled painted sculptures made of wood and metal.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch27\artsy-0001371.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Red Arrow Gallery,2500

Her canvases show the influence of both Classical compositions and Modernist geometry in equal measure. Watson’s arsenal of strokes include wide strokes of paint, energetic squiggles, dapples, and hard-edged blocking. She refers to her varied brushstrokes and mixed pigments as “moments,” each with an emotional heft and narrative weight all their own.

Moving from walls to canvas, Green’s recent paintings, influenced by the art of the Edo Period in Japan and created with gesso and sumi ink, incorporate his signature style of figurative abstraction and use of letterforms while at the same time posing metaphysical questions about the nature of narrative, the physics of time, and the possibility of immortality.

Inspired by the punk movement, graffiti art, and comics, it was a reaction against the heavily conceptual, academic, and studio driven practices of the 1970s. Extolling spontaneity and unfettered expression as virtues, Combas fills his paintings with recognizable cartoon characters, rock-n-roll imagery, cyborgs, body parts come to life, calligraphy, and sexuality, among many other elements. The paintings came from the artist’s direct visual engagement with the world, rather than an internal process of epistemic revelation.

Heidkamp straddles realism and abstraction as he privileges mood over faithful reproduction.

He drew widely from popular culture and everyday subject matter in his most famous works: his 32 Campbell's soup cans, Brillo pad box sculptures, and portraits of Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, for example. Rejecting the dominant painting and sculpting modes of his day, Warhol embraced silk-screen printmaking to achieve his characteristic hard edges and flat areas of color. The artist mentored Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and continues to influence contemporary art around the world: His provocative successors include Richard Prince, Takashi Murakami, and Jeff Koons. Warhol has been the subject of exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern, and Centre Pompidou, among other institutions.

Beard’s interest in Africa can be traced to his trips to the continent in the 1950s and ’60s, which he viewed as escapes from the high society into which he was born. During the 1970s, Beard began working for fashion magazines and became a fixture at Studio 54. Although separated by an ocean, both bodies of work are concerned with a certain kind of brutality and virulence. Beard later turned to photo-collage to bridge these two oeuvres, adding elements such as news clippings and his own blood to further explicate the themes of violence.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch29\artsy-0001427.jpg,Photography,Forum Auctions,

Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire. Since 1988, when the artist developed and curated “Freeze,” a groundbreaking exhibition of his work and that of his Goldsmiths College peers, he has been the subject of major shows at Tate Modern in London, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

Liepke paints in a style that synthesizes the work of other artists—John Singer Sargent, Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Diego Velázquez, and James McNeill Whistler, among others—to create portraits that are both visually familiar and wholly unique. Liepke favors portraits of ordinary women in glamorous contexts, producing voyeuristic nudes that are sexualized through a realistic lens rather than a pornographic one. Loose brushstrokes and dusty gray-green skin tones imbue his subjects with a fleshy sensuality, while simple gestures and expressions convey emotions. Liepke paints from photographs and works in a wet-on-wet technique, borrowed from artists like Sargent and Velázquez, in which layers of oil paint are built up without drying in between.

Once dry, the artist peels off these shapes—each one unique and hand-crafted—and layers them onto canvas or paper to create his highly-textured pieces.

For nearly 20 years, Piene served as the director of the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

White is best known for his word paintings composed of oversized, three-dimensional text painted onto cheap landscape paintings he finds at thrift stores and markets, a practice that has drawn comparisons to Ed Ruscha. Slogans and phrases such as “Fanfuckintastic” populate White’s images. He has also created grotesque, cartoonish sculptures of famous people’s heads, such as Lyndon B.

Recalling works by Joseph Beuys, Robert Rauschenberg, and the style of Arte Povera, Fyfe culls from daily refuse, especially that of impoverished areas in Southeast Asia. Fyfe’s works document regional transitions and globalization through his selected materials. Operating in the space between painting, sculpture, and architecture, Fyfe’s artworks are deliberately nonrepresentational, allowing materials to dictate form and come together on their own, rather than adhere to a preconceived artist’s vision. Fyfe is best known for his fabric-based works, which emphasize color and shape, and reveal the artist’s hand through glue lines and puckering. Selected for their individual qualities, Fyfe’s found objects are presented as-is but in a new configuration, such that they appear brand new.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch30\artsy-0001484.jpg,Sculpture,Huh Gallery,

artsy-0001486.jpg,2021,Andrew Hem,11-04-2023,Description,"Raised as the child of Cambodian immigrants in Los Angeles, Andrew Hem’s illustrative paintings bridge disparate aesthetic influences as well as cultural touchstones and sensibilities. Hem’s paintings typically highlight an individual within a group of figures, homing in on the one person who is often somberly staring out from the canvas. Using a cool palette in which the colors do not quite match up with the real world, the artist creates somber moods in illusionistic spaces set at a remove from reality. Although his color scheme—with its supernatural rendering of the natural world—elicits comparisons to impressionism, Hem also echoes graffiti art based on his straightforward and illustrative rendering of figures and space, as well as allusions to street culture, art, and fashion.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch30\artsy-0001486.jpg,Painting,Artspace Warehouse,3250

Educated as a figurative painter, he moved towards abstraction after a trip to Europe that exposed him to the major movements in modernism. Drawing influence from Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and later Hans Hofmann, he painted canvases that hint at colorful landscapes and figures behind their fragmented Cubist planes.

Boltanski often made metaphorical use of found objects, as in No Man’s Land (2010), an enormous pile of discarded jackets set to the soundtrack of thousands of human heartbeats, suggesting the anonymity, randomness, and inevitability of death. In Monuments (1985), electrical bulbs cast a seemingly bittersweet light on pictures of child holocaust victims. Describing his interest in personal histories, Boltanski said, “What drives me as an artist is that I think everyone is unique, yet everyone disappears so quickly.

They call their work the “Antimatter” series, in reference to their atomized, ghostly renderings of subjects, ranging from friends to kawaii (cute) Japanese girls, to philosophers. Both classically trained artists, the brothers honed their approach to portraiture through ten years of experimentation and travel, during which they eschewed the gallery system, presenting their work in unconventional spaces like nightclubs and corporate buildings.

artsy-0001535.jpg,2018,Matt Wedel,11-04-2023,Description,"Having grown up around his father’s pottery studio, ceramic artist Matt Wedel has long understood and respected both the intrinsic properties of the material and the element of chance that accompanies the process of firing and glazing the clay. Stepping away from the notion of ceramics as a functional craft, Wedel’s art enters the realm of mythological creation stories. Intent on recreating the world from mud or clay, he intricately models vegetation, minerals, and animals—all of which, while familiar, suggest they have roots in the unknown. His works are complex yet fluid with simple but commanding saturated color. Recognizing that “there is baggage with being a medium-specific ceramic artist today,” Wedel states his art strives to “explore the medium and expand on [its] history.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch30\artsy-0001535.jpg,Painting,Winston Wächter Fine Art,10000
artsy-0001536.jpg,2023,Ed Cohen,11-04-2023,Description,"In a spontaneous process that straddles chance and control, and suggests fleeting moments in the artist’s studio, Ed Cohen bleeds acrylic paints onto his canvases, letting the pigments express a range of sleek hues as they flow into one another. The compositions often assume circular forms, adopted by Cohen from Buddhist Enso painting, where the circle is used as a spiritual and metaphorical figure. Cohen’s use of the motif is similarly painterly, but more subjective than ideological, reflecting his meditative state in making these paintings.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch30\artsy-0001536.jpg,Painting,33 Contemporary,1800

Made with spray paint, acrylic, pencil, and other materials, these pieces call to mind the totemic canvases by Jean-Michel Basquiat and the raw compositions of such painters as Philip Guston and Francis Bacon. Gretscher began spray painting graffiti at age 16, and his style draws on the jagged expressionism of the art form.

artsy-0001539.jpg,2020,David Cheifetz,11-04-2023,Description,"David Cheifetz’s still lifes, landscapes, and narratives frequently feature absurd juxtapositions—a weight surrounded by pieces of fruit, large insects flying beside a shot of alcohol, an ear functioning as a wall-mounted lamp. Reflecting the language of dreams, these dark, hyperrealistic tableaux suggest bizarre and intriguing narratives. Cheifetz paints alla prima, an oil painting technique in which wet paint is applied to previous layers of wet paint. He works without detailed underpainting or studies, creating atmosphere through prominent, expressive brushstrokes and strong chiaroscuro. “I like to have my paintings structural and precise but at the same time loose,” he says. “I like how you can create focus in a painting by making the center of interest tight, and then you can get loose as you get more peripheral because those other things aren’t as important.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch30\artsy-0001539.jpg,Painting,Shapero Modern,

Her poupées are provocative, erotic, and uninhibitedly sexual, and function as an extension of the artist’s feelings. Now based in Barcelona, Miss Van focuses almost exclusively on studio art. Since shifting from the outdoors to an indoor setting, Miss Van’s poupées have grown increasingly refined due to the artist’s exploration of new materials and techniques. Her recent “Ballerina” series features poupées in anthropomorphic masks.

An ally of the German artist group Zero, Bonalumi—along with peers and friends Enrico Castellani and Piero Manzoni—was inspired by Lucio Fontana’s sliced canvases. He elaborated upon Fontana’s work, developing what he called “extroflexions”—intricate stretchers that molded his vinyl-coated monochromatic canvases and suggested a force pushing out from beneath. In the 1960s, Bonalumi expanded his materials to include metals, and he enlarged the scale of his work, ultimately creating installations.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch31\artsy-0001557.jpg,Painting,Robert Fontaine Gallery,5500

In her portraits, she merges a naturalistic and surrealistic approach. Harris depicts faceless heads on barely visible necks and shoulders; heads that appear to be dissipating like smoke; and doubled, fragmented faces, as if reflected in a cracked mirror. Harris only uses a computer to plan her compositions, which she executes entirely by hand.

Ivan Arlaud’s paintings evoke the happiness of life though the warmhearted and sunny atmosphere found through his various interior scenes. Though the human figure is absent, the scenes do not lack intimacy, thanks to subtle clues, like a steaming cup of coffee, barely eaten fruit, or a book of poetry laid carelessly on an unfolded tablecloth. The painter offers us an invitation to leisure or a seat at a table. He sets the scene and leaves it to us to imagine its narrative. These interiors recall the comfort of one’s home. Through warm and vivid colors, Arlaud shows a mastery of his palette, juxtaposing shades in order to form luminous oppositions. Arlaud chooses his subjects from his daily life. He appreciates photography, and his paintings are poetic transcriptions of captured images.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch31\artsy-0001562.jpg,Painting,Susan Eley Fine Art,800

Exploring overlooked architectural spaces in cities worldwide, Waite creates precisely rendered, evocative paintings based on his travels. He works primarily at large-scale and in acrylic on panel and has painted museum galleries, escalators, colonnaded passageways, and disused swimming pools at places both iconic and ordinary. Sometimes he interrupts these images with thin, fluorescent lines; other times he primes his panels with neon-colored coatings of paint, which lend a subtle glow to his compositions. Especially interested in how such places reflect the ideals of the societies for which they were built, Waite omits human figures from his depictions. In doing so, he encourages viewers to focus on the structural details of the sites and to consider the myriad ways one might experience them.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch31\artsy-0001566.jpg,Painting,Hecho Gallery,4900

Paying attention to what is behind each piece of paper “makes the collage more interesting and creates a certain mood,” he says.

Vhils studied at Central Saint Martins and honed his practice as a graffiti artist. His studio now makes prints, paintings, and posters.

Woodman studied at the Rhode Island School of Design, where she developed her practice as she took inspiration from Surrealist photographers such as Man Ray and Claude Cahun. She did not exhibit widely before her untimely death at age 22, but her work has since been shown in New York, Zürich, Berlin, Rome, Paris, and London, and has been included in institutional shows at the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson, the Vertical Gallery of the Verbund Collection, the Guggenheim Museum, and Tate Modern, among others.

The surreal-like oil paintings become considered displays of poetic absurdity, anxiety, melancholy, manual labor, pressures of life, and feelings of not belonging. Fernandez’s expressive cast of stylized figures with exaggerated features and unnatural flesh tones are proxies for the viewer to connect their own present circumstances. Fusing a variety of art historical references from Expressionism to Peter Saul to Chicago Imagists, the work engages visual metaphors, hypothetical situations, social commentary, and humor to explore the psychological and physical endurance submerged within our contemporary life. Fernandez studied at the School of Visual Arts in New York and has exhibited in New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Seoul, Philadelphia, Austin, and Seattle.

His childhood trips to Italy, where he was exposed to the Old Masters and the country’s rich artistic heritage, sparked his interest in art. He initially studied watercolor painting and later switched to oils, teaching himself how to work with the latter material. He concentrates on urban and natural landscapes and the human figure, rendering his subjects in a naturalistic, impressionistic style. Lorusso is especially interested in painting ordinary people in everyday settings, which he invests with a sense of pathos and mystery. Through his work, he aims to connect to others by conveying universal human experiences. “I believe truly great art serves as a trigger into something deeper within all of us,” he says.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch32\artsy-0001597.jpg,Painting,Parlor Gallery,4000

artsy-0001607.jpg,2009,Damien Hirst,11-04-2023,Description,"Damien Hirst, a poster boy for the Young British Artists who rose to prominence in late 1980s London, is one of the most notorious artists of his generation. He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky For the Love of God (2007), a human skull studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire. Since 1988, when the artist developed and curated “Freeze,” a groundbreaking exhibition of his work and that of his Goldsmiths College peers, he has been the subject of major shows at Tate Modern in London, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In 2008, Hirst controversially staged “Beautiful Inside my Head Forever,” an auction in which he sold his work directly to the public and raked in around $200 million for himself.

Bernhardt received her MFA from the School of Visual Arts in New York and has exhibited in New York, Tokyo, Brussels, Los Angeles, Paris, Stockholm, and beyond.

His brushy portraiture, which often includes blocky symbols of the natural world (a moon sliver, a houseplant), recalls the canvases of Katherine Bradford, Paul Gauguin, and Henri Matisse. Fox has exhibited at galleries in London, New York, Los Angeles, and Copenhagen. In 2017, he was an artist in residence at the Porthmeor Artist Residency Programme in his hometown of St. Ives.

Miyajima operates within specific material parameters: his LED lights come in a limited range of color, and count up or down between numbers 1 and 9 without ever reaching 0. He uses this limited range, however, in order to look for individuality: he has presented counters in a multitude of iterations, using both geometric and organic compositions. While critics and curators see the influence of Serial Art in Miyajima’s practice, Miyajima explains that he draws more from Buddhism. For the artist, the ticking numbers are tied to inevitability, universality, and mortality. Miyajima states: “I am making installations which experiment with different systems of time,” adding that, “There is no absolute length of time, only a personal rhythm.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch32\artsy-0001619.jpg,Print,Visions West Contemporary,20000

In addition to his street art, C215 has produced works expressing his social concerns; his stenciled acrylic rendering of four young children, Favela Boys (2008), is one example. He has also produced portraits of leading global figures including former U.S. president Barack Obama and French cultural icon Serge Gainsbourg. C215 travels to neglected areas to create his large-scale murals, many of which can occupy the entire side of a building.

Born in a region rich with Italian and Slavic influences, his artistic narrative was marked by a unique fusion of cultural styles. Mušič’s experience as a Dachau concentration camp survivor during World War II profoundly influenced his art, inspiring the series “We Are Not the Last” which depicted skeletal figures within desolate landscapes. Despite this somber subject matter, Mušič's work also encompassed luminous landscapes, typically stripped of specific geographical markers and simplified into lyrical forms. He was awarded the Prešeren Award, the highest cultural honor in Slovenia, in 1991.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch33\artsy-0001653.jpg,Painting,A.Style,7000

These apparently spontaneous marks recall the canvases of Jean-Michel Basquiat or Cy Twombly; the Spanish-born and -based Plans names graffiti, street art, comic books, illustrations, and animated films as major influences. Yet it’s really his characters, which Plans describes as “Hero Animals,” which have helped the artist win popularity and a number of gallery shows around Spain. Plans’s work has found high demand on the secondary market; his paintings have sold for six figures. Despite their vibrant color palette and cartoon-indebted aesthetics, Plans’s paintings tackle serious subject matter: With his animal heroes, he intends to criticize gender violence, racism, and envy.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch33\artsy-0001661.jpg,Sculpture,Gallery Art,59963

artsy-0001673.jpg,1995,Per Kirkeby,11-04-2023,Description,"Inspired by his early training as a geologist, Per Kirkeby made quasi-abstract paintings of landscapes. He was influenced by the gestural works of mid-century Abstract Expressionism and was often labeled a Neo-Expressionist. The artist rendered his scenes with thick, aggressive strokes of earthen hues and glints of yellow and blue; outlining trees, boulders, and figures in black, he kept his work from pure abstraction. Throughout his five-decade career, Kirkeby also pursued architecture, poetry, and sculpture, and he worked on visual effects for the films of Lars von Trier. As an early member of the experimental Fluxus group, he participated in performances and Happenings organized by Joseph Beuys and Jörg Immendorff. Kirkeby exhibited widely during his lifetime and enjoyed solo shows in New York, Paris, Copenhagen, London, and Cologne. He represented Denmark at the Venice Biennale in 1976 and 1980. His work has sold for six figures at auction and belongs in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Tate, the Centre Pompidou, and the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, among many others.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch34\artsy-0001673.jpg,Print,K Contemporary,12000

Often associated with the Fluxus movement, Beuys focused on what he called “social sculpture,” engaging his audience and the environment in new ways. He produced assemblages, installations, performances, prints, and drawings, among other media, which usually embraced a philosophical, humanist message. Various projects involved planting trees, living with a coyote for three days, and teaching itself: The artist was an influential instructor at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf whose students included Anatol Herzfeld, Blinky Palermo, and Sigmar Polke. Beuys participated in the Venice Biennale and Documenta many times and has been the subject of exhibitions at institutions including Moderna Museet, Tate Modern, the Kunsthalle Bern, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art, among others.

In the ongoing “The Malediction of Cham” series, Plaisir draws on the Curse of Cham, or Ham, a misinterpretation of a biblical story that has been used to justify racism. Paying homage to Black activists like Nina Simone, James Baldwin, and Aretha Franklin, Plaisir portrays the celebrities against a black background; she uses a unique shade created by Plaisr from multiple elements within her palette in order to emphasize the beauty and diversity of the color. The subjects, surrounded by organic and floral motifs drawn from Plaisir’s Caribbean heritage, exemplify the vision of an oppressionless utopia.

artsy-0001683.jpg,2023,Audra Weaser,11-04-2023,Description,"The inspiration for Audra Weaser’s abstract landscapes comes from the Southern California terrain of her upbringing, particularly her memories of the transitions between mountains, ocean, and desert. Weaser studied abstract, non-objective painting, though her earliest works were sanded wall sculptures. Her best-known body of paintings borrows from both approaches. She begins each work by applying layers of color to wood panel, and then covers the surface in an overlay of white paint. Later, she sands away the layers—a process she calls “excavation”—to create compositions that resemble reflections of forests on water. Weaser explains: “The trees reflecting on a watery plain reveal a shimmering version rather than a solid fact. My paintings are a desire to . . . reconnect to the unseen as a resonating poetic experience.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch34\artsy-0001683.jpg,Painting,GALLERY MoMo,860

Later paintings isolated sections of famous brand logos, which became some of the most famous instances of Italian Pop Art, shown alongside contemporaries such as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. In the late 1960s, he turned to landscapes, which manifested as semi-abstract compositions often left half-finished, showing the paper underneath. Schifano’s work has been widely exhibited, including a retrospective at Rome’s National Gallery of Modern Art, and his experimentation with form and cultural iconography secured his legacy as a significant figure in 20th-century Italian art.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch34\artsy-0001695.jpg,Painting,Lions Gallery,1500
