The artist’s signature faceless figures—adrift in starkly lined, color-saturated worlds—attracted attention from collectors, the press, and fellow East Village art-world acolytes. Kostabi began exhibiting throughout the city and internationally, and his work has sold for five figure prices at auction. His paintings, along with his irreverent media appearances and opulent, three-floor mega-studio (dubbed “Kostabi World”), all commented on the absurd commercialism and commodification of art in the decades leading up to the new millennium.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch1\artsy-0000002.jpg,Painting,Martin Lawrence Galleries,13850

In portraits, landscapes, architectural details, still lifes, and everything in between, Stitt seeks the “golden moment”—the particular combination of light, contrast, and juxtaposition that gives his subjects a timeless beauty. “I would consider my work successful if a viewer saw something they would never think twice about looking at in one of my paintings, yet this time they noticed it and think it looks lovely,” he says. “And if that person then left the place where they saw the painting and went about their business, and in the course of that business noticed something else that is mundane at one of those magical moments, when it is transformed from the ordinary into the beautiful, and they stopped and noticed how lovely it is … if they did this all because my painting reminded them to do this, then my work, and my painting, has been successful.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch1\artsy-0000007.jpg,Painting,Gallery NAGA,400

Kahn’s signature landscapes took inspiration from the palettes of Henri Matisse and the ethos of his Vermont farm: He painted weathered barns, undulating pastures, and tree lines that embraced a spare, evocative New England aesthetic. Kahn studied under Hans Hofmann and cited Mark Rothko, J.M.W. Turner, and Pierre Bonnard as additional influences. He worked intuitively, refusing to overthink any psychological underpinnings in his paintings.

Her work has been featured in solo and group exhibitions at galleries in Los Angeles, London, Mexico City, São Paolo, and Madrid. Residencies in Portugal, Spain, England, and Morocco opened her eyes to the lives of women in different parts of the world. Perrotta symbolically strips away cultural differences to expose the common experiences women share—like insecurities around body image and the awareness of the male gaze—and translates them into the curves and shapes of her minimal compositions.

Playing with light and shadow, Bestard’s work is at once alluring and unsettling: In Repentat (2021), a figure dressed in a dark coat kneels on the ground, its face partially obscured by wavy hair. The background surrounding the subject is charcoal black, adding to the somber tone of the work. Though he avoids labeling himself, Bestard draws on traditional Realist techniques to create paintings with Surrealist subject matter in muted palettes of greys and browns. The figures in his paintings are often depicted in uncanny, dreamlike situations: Shouting at each other, as in Shout II (2017), or balancing a flag with one hand, as in Flag bearer (2019).",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000034.jpg,Painting,Galeria Contrast,

The artist, who grew up between Japan and America, loads his large-scale canvases (sometimes irregularly shaped or divided into panels) with references to his bicultural background: He has taken inspiration from Pop art and manga, cowboys and samurai, graffiti and the Meiji era, Abstract Expressionism and woodblock printing. Matsuyama imbues his energetic scenes with a playful, high-octane color palette. The compositions often blur the boundaries between domestic interiors and the natural world. Matsuyama received his MFA from Pratt Institute in 2004. Since then, he has exhibited in Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York, among other cities.

Two years later, she was the first woman and the first African artist to be commissioned to paint a BMW Art Car.

In Death of Sardanapalus (1827), figures and animals seem to writhe across the picture plane. Like Ingres, Delacroix was fascinated by the Orient, which includes present-day Turkey, Greece, and North Africa, visiting Morocco in 1832. Yet, instead of highlighting the seductive quality of his exotic subjects, Delacroix took an avid interest in the violence and cruelty in Oriental subjects. His lush palette and passionate brushwork would later greatly influence the development of both Impressionism and Post-Impressionism",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000044.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Riva Advisory,9500

Many of his provocative pieces deconstruct and deride luxury culture, and Sachs has explicitly paired fashion brands with violent or debased subject matter. His Prada Toilet (1997) is a toilet created from cardboard Prada packaging, for example, while his Chanel Guillotine (Breakfast Nook) (1998) looks like a branded torture device.

artsy-0000056.jpg,2023,David LaChapelle,11-04-2023,Description,"American photographer and video artist David LaChapelle is renowned for his hyperrealistic, highly saturated, and often controversial editorial portraits of celebrities. Over the course of his prolific career, he’s shot many of pop culture’s most recognizable faces—from Nicki Minaj, Britney Spears, and Madonna to Tupac Shakur, Michael Jackson, and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson—in a humorous style that combines elements of Surrealism and Pop art. In addition to shooting for publications such as Rolling Stone and Interview, LaChapelle has maintained a fine-art photography practice. Much of his work has explored themes of mortality and transcendence, with overt references to art history and religious iconography. He has featured in shows at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, the Musée d'Orsay, and the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., among other institutions.

artsy-0000057.jpg,1984,Sam Gilliam,11-04-2023,Description,"Since the 1960s, Washington Color School painter Sam Gilliam has tested the boundaries of color, form, texture, abstraction, and the canvas itself. His most significant innovations may be his “Drape” paintings: lengths of unstretched, unprimed canvases covered in fields of deeply saturated color and layers of poured paint. Gilliam drapes these works across walls or hangs them from the ceiling in a manner that can suggest theater curtains, flags, or hanging laundry. Throughout his canvases and works on paper, the artist has also employed various folding and staining techniques. His work belongs in the collections of the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Tate Modern. Gilliam has enjoyed exhibitions in New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Basel, Seoul, and Washington, D.C., among other cities. At auction, a number of his pieces have sold for seven figures. Inspired by the spirit of improvisational jazz, Gilliam continues to experiment with depth, physicality, and resonances of color.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000057.jpg,Painting,Heritage Auctions,24000
artsy-0000058.jpg,2019,David Gerstein,11-04-2023,Description,"An Israeli painter and sculptor, David Gerstein seeks to transcend the limits of two-dimensional painting via his vibrant three-dimensional sculptures. He is particularly well known for his large-scale public installations, the largest of which is Momentum (2008) in Singapore. Gerstein’s work from the 1970s focused on figurative paintings and watercolors depicting scenes from his childhood. A recurring bicycle motif in these works reappears in later pieces. Steel-cut figures first appeared in his art in the early 1980s and they continue to assist him in illustrating everything from childhood to the natural world. These themes can be seen in Nature Lover (ca. 2020), with a bicycle in silhouette combined with a burst of brightly colored butterflies that surround and follow the rider. Gerstein continues to work in paint, creating brightly colored compositions such as 20.13 (2020) that meet his desire to speak to the art world while remaining accessible to the public.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000058.jpg,Sculpture,Galerie Duret,
artsy-0000059.jpg,1969,Saul Steinberg,11-04-2023,Description,"Perhaps most famous for his New Yorker illustrations and cartoons, Saul Steinberg also made paintings, drawings, photographs, collages, and sculptures that chronicled the modern American psyche. His style is characterized by emotive linework, a mélange of high and low cultural references, and an acute eye for the details and absurdities of city life. While his work could be humorous, Steinberg also made surreal tableaux and offered profound meditations on the post-war experience. Early in his career, the artist made advertisements that were published in magazines including Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, Fortune, and Time. Steinberg’s work has been exhibited in New York, London, Paris, Tokyo, Berlin, Los Angeles, and Copenhagen. His work belongs in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Centre Pompidou, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Moderna Museet, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000059.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Heritage Auctions,8000

He arranges the layers of paper in a horizontal grid, paying homage to pioneering Modernists and Minimalists such as Piet Mondrian, Kenneth Noland, and Morris Louis. A resin topcoat renders the surface shiny and the paper transparent, so that the images on the backsides bleed through to the front, creating a sense of depth. Paying attention to what is behind each piece of paper “makes the collage more interesting and creates a certain mood,” he says. Verbicky’s collages, which can be “read” in any direction, evoke familiar scenes and subjects, from flowers in bloom, to a racetrack blurred in action, to stock tickers scrolling across a television screen.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000063.jpg,Mixed Media,L Kotler Fine Art,39000

He has participated in a number of street art crews, most famously West Coast Artists (WCA) and the Seventh Letter. In the course of his nearly 30-year career, Graval has become one of the most influential figures for subsequent generations of graffiti artists, particularly in Los Angeles.

Each is a collage of hundreds of paint swatches Smith has assembled to form images of iconic paintings, like his tributes to masterpieces by Grant Wood and Leonardo da Vinci, American Gothic (2020) and Mona Lisa 1 (2015). Smith began reconstructing paintings in 2014, when he recreated Andy Warhol’s portrait of Marilyn Monroe. His works are highly sought after by international collectors. While best known for his replicas of museum masterpieces, Smith also uses color chips to reproduce movie posters, nude portraits, and still lifes of condiments. He also incorporates text into his pieces by replacing paint names on swatches with evocative words, adding a narrative layer to the work.

artsy-0000066.jpg,1985,Keith Haring,11-04-2023,Description,"Keith Haring rose to prominence in 1980s New York within the East Village art scene alongside Jean-Michel Basquiat, Kenny Scharf, and Jenny Holzer. He bridged the gap between the art world and the street, graffiting city subways and sidewalks before committing to a studio practice. Haring united the appeal of cartoons with the raw energy of Art Brut artists such as Jean DuBuffet as he developed a distinct pop-graffiti aesthetic that comprised energetic, boldly outlined figures against solid or patterned backdrops. His major themes included exploitation, subjugation, drug abuse, and the threat of nuclear holocaust; Haring boldly engaged with social issues, especially after receiving an AIDS diagnosis in 1987. Today, his work sells for seven figures at auction and has been the subject of solo shows at the Brooklyn Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Albertina Museum in Vienna, among other institutions.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000066.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",VINCE fine arts/ephemera,24000

Mixing nontraditional materials such as silver deposit with acrylic paints, Gleason’s surfaces are highly reactive to light and shifts in the viewer’s position. Rather than using focusing on the surface as an end in itself, his paintings track the play of light and the movement of the viewer across the surface, thereby acting as a mirror onto the external world. Through this movement, Gleason hopes to induce a meditative experience for his viewers.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000073.jpg,Painting,SCAPE,48000

artsy-0000075.jpg,1985,Sol LeWitt,11-04-2023,Description,"Sol LeWitt famously stressed the importance of the ideas that animated his artwork over the particulars of their execution. A leading figure of the Conceptual and Minimalist movements, he maintained a practice that included drawing, printmaking, photography, painting, installation, sculpture, and writing. He is perhaps best known for simple, geometric drawings and wall paintings and for his “structures”: modular sculptures of cubed forms, variously constructed from steel, polyurethane, wood, or concrete. LeWitt also received attention for his writings on the nature of Conceptual art. To “install” his wall paintings, contemporary exhibition spaces must follow a set of instructions the artist left behind. LeWitt received his BFA from Syracuse University. After graduating, he took classes at the Cartoonists and Illustrators School (now the School of Visual Arts), worked as a graphic designer and, later, worked shifts at the Museum of Modern Art alongside artists such as Dan Flavin and Robert Mangold. His work has been exhibited in a number of institutions including the Museum of Modern Art, MoMA PS1, the Centre Pompidou, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and the Pérez Art Museum Miami; it also belongs in the collections of countless museums including the Tate, the Guggenheim Museum, Dia Beacon, and the Musée National d’Art Moderne in Paris.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000075.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Heritage Auctions,8000

Taking his cues from Andy Warhol’s Pop art seriality, the artist uses repetition as a form of creative meditation which unlocks subconscious sentiment. The son of a naval officer, Slonem honed his craft at Tulane University in New Orleans and, later, at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, where he was exposed to artists including Alice Neel and Alex Katz. Today, his work sells for five figures on the secondary market and can be found in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Bahrain National Museum, and the Guilin Art Museum, among other institutions.

Rather than critique consumerist culture, Wesley’s cartoonish paintings, inspired to an extent by René Magritte and Giorgio de Chirico, celebrate fantasy and express human fears and desires. They reference popular culture (especially the comic strip “Blondie”), but fix “on the neurotic, erotically inclined psyche of the American male, with its rage and frustration, longing and loss,” according to New York Times critic Andrea K.

Over a career spanning six decades, he became a major figure of the Post-Minimalist generation, developing an abstract geometric style that often made use of found wood and rusted steel. In 1971, he was included in the legendary exhibition “Under The Brooklyn Bridge,” organized by Alanna Heiss and Gordon Matta-Clark. His work from the 1970s frequently challenged conventional modes of display with Back Floorpiece (1979) being typical of this approach, functioning less as an aesthetic object than a series of spatial markers. He continued to believe in the power of objects to change space throughout his career, placing 39 boulders in a winding configuration in a grassy meadow at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in 1989. Although best known for his sculptural works, Nonas also produced small abstract works in oilstick on paper such as Under (Fieldnotes) (2018).",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch2\artsy-0000091.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Galerie Hubert Winter,30000

In her portraits, she merges a naturalistic and surrealistic approach.

artsy-0000104.jpg,2016,Louise Fishman,11-04-2023,Description,"Abstract painter Louise Fishman was drawn to personal experience, stories, and political activism. Through the 1960s, she produced primarily Minimalist-inspired, grid-like paintings. In the early 1970s, in pursuit of a more definitively feminine practice, she gave up abstract painting, which was considered the hotbed of art world machismo, to explore sculptural processes like sewing and knitting, which were traditionally defined as “women’s work.” Returning to painting in 1973, she produced a series called “Angry Women,” which announced the expressive brushwork and muddy pigment that are hallmarks of her mature style. In 1988, a trip to Eastern Europe, where she visited two concentration camps, reinforced the dark, mysteriously emotive quality of Fishman’s vigorously worked paintings, including her 1989 series of eight paintings, “Remembrance and Renewal,” in which she mixed ashes and beeswax into her paints.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch3\artsy-0000104.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Goya Contemporary/Goya-Girl Press,9100

These drawings resemble black-and-white newspaper photos from the early 20th century, and suggest a pseudo-documentary archive of the pursuits of Murrow’s characters. Although he deals with grand themes of human ambition, Murrow infuses his work with absurdist humor, revealing the comedic failure of his subjects.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch3\artsy-0000107.jpg,Sculpture,Galerie Les filles du calvaire,

artsy-0000140.jpg,,Ralph Albert Blakelock,11-04-2023,Description,"With the exception of James Abbott McNeill Whistler and Albert Pinkham Ryder, no American Tonalist was more crucial to the development of American modernism than Ralph Albert Blakelock. Although he started out as a somewhat conventional Hudson River School painter, his poetic and symbolic moonlights of the 1890s, with their emphasis on pattern and abstract design and manipulated paint surfaces, changed the face of American art. Blakelock’s scintillating dream-like nocturnes reward close inspection for their interplay of color, tone, subtle vibration, refracted edges, jagged rhythmic patterns, and dissonant harmonies. The artist endlessly experimented with surface textures: scumbling, scraping, and even pumicing his lacquer-like pigments. Blakelock’s works are replete with analogues to nature’s underlying armature, even mimicking the organic structure visible on the microscopic level of cellular formation, or writ large in the more apparent structures of the environment, from plant morphology and animal physiology to geologic structures.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch4\artsy-0000140.jpg,Painting,Questroyal Fine Art,150000

While Avery’s subject matter was decidedly representational—the artist often captured domestic scenes and serene landscapes—his bright color palettes and pared-back compositions inspired a number of artists in the New York avant-garde including Mark Rothko, Adolph Gottlieb, and Barnett Newman. Avery studied at the Connecticut League of Art Students and the School of the Art Society of Hartford. He exhibited in New York, London, Venice, and Los Angeles, and his works belong in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Brooklyn Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky For the Love of God (2007), a human skull studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire. Since 1988, when the artist developed and curated “Freeze,” a groundbreaking exhibition of his work and that of his Goldsmiths College peers, he has been the subject of major shows at Tate Modern in London, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In 2008, Hirst controversially staged “Beautiful Inside my Head Forever,” an auction in which he sold his work directly to the public and raked in around $200 million for himself.

In 2014, the series earned Mosse the prestigious Deutsche Börse Prize. The artist received his MFA in photography from Yale in 2008 and has since exhibited at The Bass, Foam Fotografiemuseum, and Tate Modern, among other institutions.

Referencing comic books, classic television characters, and other pop imagery, Gross creates a witty blend of advertising, propaganda, and Surrealism. In 2012, Alex Gross’s solo exhibition, “Product Placement,” lampooned the ubiquitous and disturbing presence of product promotions and advertising in everyday life. Gross has said of the subject matter in his work: “The world that I live in is both spiritually profound and culturally vapid. It is extremely violent but can also be extremely beautiful. Globalization and technology are responsible for wonderfully positive changes in the world as well as terrible tragedy and homogeneity. This dichotomy fascinates me, and naturally influences much of my work.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch4\artsy-0000156.jpg,Painting,Haven Gallery,14000

His characters include Cookie the Baby Orangutan, Jane the Pug Girl, Jack the Jack Russell Terror, Loretta the Actress Cat, and Miss Dog America; supporting roles have gone to dill pickles, asparagus stalks, olives, cigarette butts, and matches.

His figurative canvases feature rounded, wide-eyed figures and geometric landscapes drenched in vibrant Fauvist hues. The rest of his oeuvre adds texture to his singular vision and—in his elaborate, immersive exhibitions—extends it into the third dimension. Party studied at the École cantonale d’art de Lausanne in Switzerland before receiving his MFA from the Glasgow School of Art in Scotland. He has exhibited in cities including New York, Los Angeles, Brussels, Zürich, Beijing, and Paris, among others. Party’s work belongs in the collections of the Hammer Museum, the K11 Art Foundation, the Kunsthaus Zürich, the Rubell Museum, and the X Museum, and his paintings have fetched million-dollar prices on the secondary market.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch4\artsy-0000161.jpg,Print,MLTPL,

Since 2009, the Swiss artist has been creating a series of body paintings on paper or emergency foil blankets that allude to Yves Kleins’ “Anthropometry” paintings. In other works, Rosenkranz has scattered Fiji water and Gatorade bottles filled with paint or colored fluid throughout the gallery space. The absence of the body in Rosenkranz’s work elicits a paradox at the core of her practice, one in which she attempts to escape the centrality of the human while also recognizing it as the source of corporeal and intellectual perception.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch4\artsy-0000162.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Swiss Institute Benefit Auction,7000

Taking his cues from Andy Warhol’s Pop art seriality, the artist uses repetition as a form of creative meditation which unlocks subconscious sentiment. The son of a naval officer, Slonem honed his craft at Tulane University in New Orleans and, later, at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, where he was exposed to artists including Alice Neel and Alex Katz. Today, his work sells for five figures on the secondary market and can be found in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Bahrain National Museum, and the Guilin Art Museum, among other institutions.

He drew widely from popular culture and everyday subject matter in his most famous works: his 32 Campbell's soup cans, Brillo pad box sculptures, and portraits of Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, for example. Rejecting the dominant painting and sculpting modes of his day, Warhol embraced silk-screen printmaking to achieve his characteristic hard edges and flat areas of color. The artist mentored Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and continues to influence contemporary art around the world: His provocative successors include Richard Prince, Takashi Murakami, and Jeff Koons. Warhol has been the subject of exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern, and Centre Pompidou, among other institutions.

Inspired by Existentialist philosophy and a rejection of his bourgeois childhood, Modigliani chose not to paint landscapes, like many of his contemporaries, instead using portraiture to explore both his own psychology and that of his subjects, who were typically fellow artists or lovers. Modigliani also painted highly sexualized female nudes that at the time, were daringly erotic. His style is figurative but also highly expressive, and his subjects are shown with quirks and asymmetries, recalling the portraiture of Paul Cézanne, whose work Modigliani greatly admired. Modigliani befriended Pablo Picasso after moving to Paris in 1906, and like Picasso, he drew inspiration from art of so-called “primitive” cultures, his work often resembling African or Pre-Columbian statuary.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch4\artsy-0000184.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",AUTOGRAPHES DES SIECLES,

According to Quaresma, making the series “was a process of rescuing my identity.” “In the studio space I worked over the images with geometrical lines and casual acrylic brush marks, creating a duality between documentary and imaginary.” Throughout Quaresma’s body of work, negotiations between the intimate and universal, personal and political, and physical and psychological are present and emphasized by her drawn interventions.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch4\artsy-0000193.jpg,Mixed Media,Patrick Heide Contemporary Art,

His works often united elements of sculpture, painting, printmaking, photography, and drawing, making meaning through juxtapositions of disparate media and minimalist, gridlike compositions. Fragmentation and Germany’s political climate were major themes throughout his oeuvre. Förg is also well known for his photographs of architecture. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich and exhibited in London, Paris, Berlin, Hong Kong, New York, Milan, and Rome, among other cities. Förg’s work belongs in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Stedelijk Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, and the Museum Ludwig, among others.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch5\artsy-0000214.jpg,Print,MLTPL,

He has been the subject of dozens of exhibitions at major institutions and, in 1964, he featured at the 32nd Venice Biennale and Documenta 3.

""I wanted to show how good I look,” Fosso has noted about these early pictures, referencing his practice of dressing up in bell bottoms, disco boots, hotpants, and other costume attire for his self-portraits.

Since the 1960s, Ruscha has made photographic books, tongue-in-cheek photo collages, paintings, and drawings that demonstrate a keen interest in language and the idiosyncrasies of life in Los Angeles, where the artist has lived since the 1950s. In his most famous works, he places words and phrases from the colloquial and consumerist vernacular atop photographic images or fields of color—a strategy that situates him within a larger Pop art lineage. Ruscha often paints and draws with unusual materials such as gunpowder, blood, and Pepto Bismol, drawing attention to the deterioration of language and the pervasive clichés in American culture. Ruscha’s work has been exhibited across the globe, and the artist has enjoyed solo shows at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and Moderna Museet, in addition to the Venice Biennale, where he represented the United States in 2005.

The son of a naval officer, Slonem honed his craft at Tulane University in New Orleans and, later, at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, where he was exposed to artists including Alice Neel and Alex Katz. Today, his work sells for five figures on the secondary market and can be found in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Bahrain National Museum, and the Guilin Art Museum, among other institutions.

artsy-0000269.jpg,1916,Charles Ephraim Burchfield,11-04-2023,Description,"Regarded as one of America’s most significant modernist painters, Charles Burchfield was known for his dark, eerie watercolor paintings of Midwestern cities and towns—and the rural landscapes and industrial developments at their edges. Drawing from subjects including design theory, European modernism, and Chinese and Japanese artmaking, Burchfield developed a unique style notable for its deeply personal symbolic language, distorted forms, and quirky, expressive elements. His early work exudes a sense of whimsy, and his depictions of architecture and nature seem alive with energy. The artist recaptured this fantastical sensibility in the 1940s, after a period of painting in a more realistic style. Burchfield rose to fame in 1930, when the newly opened Museum of Modern Art staged a show of his early work—the museum’s first single-artist exhibition. Since then, he’s been the subject of retrospectives at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Hammer Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Columbus Museum of Art.

artsy-0000272.jpg,2003,"Kaikai Kiki,",11-04-2023,Description,"One of the most acclaimed artists to emerge from post-war Asia, Takashi Murakami is known for his signature “Superflat” aesthetic: a colorful, two-dimensional style that straddles the division between fine art and pop culture as it unites elements of anime, Japanese nihonga, and ukiyo-e woodcuts. Common motifs across Murakami’s oeuvre—which spans paintings, sculptures, prints, and more—include smiling flowers, bears, and the Mickey Mouse–inspired character Mr. DOB. They also appear throughout Murakami’s thriving market for merchandise and collectibles. Murakami has presented at institutions including the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, MoMA PS1, Mori Art Museum, Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, Brooklyn Museum, Museum für Moderne Kunst, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, among others, and his work has sold for millions on the secondary market.

Dalí’s fantastical prints, paintings, sculptures, films, and writing helped cement the movement’s identity. Working off psychoanalytic ideas, Dalí rendered fantastical creatures and landscapes that could unsettle and awe. His 1931 canvas The Persistence of Memory is one of the most recognizable artworks of all time. Dalí exhibited widely in his lifetime, and his works belong in the collections of institutions including the Tate, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Art Institute of Chicago, among others.

""I wanted to show how good I look,” Fosso has noted about these early pictures, referencing his practice of dressing up in bell bottoms, disco boots, hotpants, and other costume attire for his self-portraits.

Haring united the appeal of cartoons with the raw energy of Art Brut artists such as Jean DuBuffet as he developed a distinct pop-graffiti aesthetic that comprised energetic, boldly outlined figures against solid or patterned backdrops. His major themes included exploitation, subjugation, drug abuse, and the threat of nuclear holocaust; Haring boldly engaged with social issues, especially after receiving an AIDS diagnosis in 1987.

Riley studied at Goldsmiths’ College and the Royal College of Art and worked briefly in advertising before transitioning to full-time artmaking.

After settling in the Central African Republic, he made a living taking wedding portraits and passport pictures, and began using the leftover frames to take self-portraits, at first to send to his grandmother in Nigeria. ""I wanted to show how good I look,” Fosso has noted about these early pictures, referencing his practice of dressing up in bell bottoms, disco boots, hotpants, and other costume attire for his self-portraits.

In a predominantly flat, decorative style, Brown painted figures and animals in fanciful scenarios; enamored with ancient Egyptian art and mythology, she would often paint silhouettes and human-animal hybrids such as the sphinx.

More recent works feature unremarkably dressed contemporary figures, rendered with enough detail to almost suggest three-dimensional portraiture. However, showing no signs of emotion and bearing no socio-critical references, they retain considerable banality. “I’m perhaps proposing a story and not telling the end, just giving a beginning or fragment.

David Yarrow is recognized as one of the world’s best-selling photographers. He has found his true comfort zone in capturing the animal and human world in a fresh and creative way. A key part of his success has been creating art through partnerships with a philanthropic objective and this has enabled him to work with leading figures in sports, fashion, and Hollywood, such as Cindy Crawford, Cara Delevingne, Ciara and Russell Wilson, and Alessandra Ambrosio. Since 2019, charitable donations from the sale of Yarrow’s images have exceeded $10 million.
Yarrow was born in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1966. He took up photography at an early age and as a 20-year-old found himself working as a photographer for The London Times on the pitch at the World Cup Final in Mexico City. On that day, David took the famous picture of Diego Maradona holding the World Cup and, as a result, was subsequently asked to cover the Olympics and numerous other sporting events. His distinctive work in recent years has earned him an ever-growing following amongst art collectors. Yarrow is now represented by some of the top contemporary galleries around the world.

Motonaga graduated from trade school; with aspirations to be a manga artist, he began to make figural and landscape works on canvas under the tutelage of painter Mankichi Hamabe. In 1952, he began to make abstract objects and paintings, which garnered him an invitation to join the Gutai exhibitions. One of his most famous works was a site-specific installation with pools of colored water suspended in vinyl tubes hanging from trees. From then, he experimented with water and smoke as ephemeral artistic materials. Inspired in part by tarashikomi techniques in traditional Japanese painting, he began to make paintings generated by chance, tilting canvases and pooling paint.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch9\artsy-0000381.jpg,Painting,鳩ノ森美術 / HATONOMORI ART,55000

The artist begins each work by applying acrylic paint to wax paper, fashioning thousands of brightly-colored ovals and drips. Once dry, the artist peels off these shapes—each one unique and hand-crafted—and layers them onto canvas or paper to create his highly-textured pieces. Chacon compares this process to a social gathering, as he brings together a variety of disparate elements into a single unit. For a recent series, Chacon looked to the culture and myths of Ancient Rome, producing monochromatic paintings in deep purples and golds that reflect the society’s imperial colors.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch10\artsy-0000389.jpg,Painting,Margaret Thatcher Projects,22000

Ruff came to prominence as part of the Düsseldorf School, a loosely affiliated group of photographers who studied under Bernd and Hilla Becher. The seriality of his subjects takes inspiration from the Bechers’ embrace of “typologies” in their own work. Ruff has exhibited in New York, London, Tokyo, Berlin, Paris, and many other cities.

After settling in the Central African Republic, he made a living taking wedding portraits and passport pictures, and began using the leftover frames to take self-portraits, at first to send to his grandmother in Nigeria. ""I wanted to show how good I look,” Fosso has noted about these early pictures, referencing his practice of dressing up in bell bottoms, disco boots, hotpants, and other costume attire for his self-portraits. More recently, in his series “African Spirits” (2008), Fosso has continued to transform his appearance by posing as fourteen iconic figures of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, casting himself as Angela Davis, Malcolm X, and Muhammad Ali, among others.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch10\artsy-0000400.jpg,Photography,Christophe Person,

Hockney first gained recognition for his semi-abstract paintings of gay love.

artsy-0000413.jpg,1970,Beverly Pepper,11-04-2023,Description,"With her monumental, rust-colored abstract sculptures that gently slope and curve, Beverly Pepper helped introduce Cor-Ten steel as a medium with desirable aesthetic and weather-resistant qualities. Despite their extraordinary weight, Pepper’s curvilinear steel forms, such as Curved Presence (2012), often appear light and buoyant. After training at the Pratt Institute, Pepper began her career as a social realist painter; she transitioned to sculpture somewhat organically, carving her first pieces from trees fallen in her garden in Rome. She was asked to participate in the 1962 “Festival of Two Worlds” in Spoleto, Italy which included works by Alexander Calder and Henry Moore. To prepare for the exhibition, Pepper began working with metal and learned to weld in order to create Il Dono di Icaro (“The Gift of Icarus”) (1962)—an iron and steel sculpture that still stands in the Italian town. Her stainless steel sculptures with mirrored surfaces, such as Torre Pieno nel Vuoto (1968), connect to their environment by reflecting the surrounding landscape.

His sculpture similarly embraces popular culture, though it is also directly influenced by the work of the French artist Arman, who exhibited commercial objects as sculpture in the 1960s.

After experiencing disillusionment with his native Chile and studies in art school, Castillo developed his current style out of “frustration and anger,” and a dark sense of humor. His works spin ominous allegorical and political narratives of current world crises in post-apocalyptic settings; greed, chaos, brutality and destruction are frequent themes in his work. The protagonists of his paintings are frequently children with blank eyes—the artist’s metaphor for ignorance. Castillo admits that people might find his works “a little tenebrous or even satanic,” but explains that he is not a dark person, and is instead interested in creating accessible art.

artsy-0000435.jpg,1985,Sol LeWitt,11-04-2023,Description,"Sol LeWitt famously stressed the importance of the ideas that animated his artwork over the particulars of their execution. A leading figure of the Conceptual and Minimalist movements, he maintained a practice that included drawing, printmaking, photography, painting, installation, sculpture, and writing. He is perhaps best known for simple, geometric drawings and wall paintings and for his “structures”: modular sculptures of cubed forms, variously constructed from steel, polyurethane, wood, or concrete. LeWitt also received attention for his writings on the nature of Conceptual art. To “install” his wall paintings, contemporary exhibition spaces must follow a set of instructions the artist left behind. LeWitt received his BFA from Syracuse University. After graduating, he took classes at the Cartoonists and Illustrators School (now the School of Visual Arts), worked as a graphic designer and, later, worked shifts at the Museum of Modern Art alongside artists such as Dan Flavin and Robert Mangold. His work has been exhibited in a number of institutions including the Museum of Modern Art, MoMA PS1, the Centre Pompidou, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and the Pérez Art Museum Miami; it also belongs in the collections of countless museums including the Tate, the Guggenheim Museum, Dia Beacon, and the Musée National d’Art Moderne in Paris.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch10\artsy-0000435.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Heritage Auctions,8000

Drawing on influences ranging from Johannes Vermeer to Edward Hopper, Sato uses predominantly solo figures facing away from the viewer, inviting them to look below the surface. Amalgamation (2018) reflects Sato’s use of expressive interiors and a harmonious color palette painted in a geometric style, revealing his interest in the design principles of the Old Masters.

De Groot received a degree in illustration and painting from Minerva Art Academy and illustrated nature books before devoting himself to painting full-time in 1999. He takes inspiration from artists such as Gustav Klimt and Mark Rothko, as well as Dutch masters like Johannes Vermeer and Rembrandt. This dual influence is evident in his work. The artist stages precise renderings of wildlife—particularly birds of the northern hemisphere—against impressionistic landscape backgrounds defined by contrasting daubs of color. De Groot has been featured in multiple exhibitions, including at the National Museum of Wildlife Art, the Hague’s Kunstzaal van Heijningen, and the Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch10\artsy-0000441.jpg,Painting,Gerald Peters Gallery,13600

While his recurring skull, soldier, and bullet motifs speak to unthinkable trauma and brutality, Aboudia’s bright color palettes reinforce the enduring innocence of the children who live amid the chaos. Aboudia has exhibited widely across Côte d’Ivoire and in London, Paris, New York, and Marrakesh, among other cities.

His photographs, sculptures, films, performances, and installations earned him ire from the Chinese government, which imprisoned him for 81 days in 2011 and razed his studio in 2018. Ai left the country in 2015. His most lauded works include Sunflower Seeds (2010)—for which the artist scattered 100 million porcelain “seeds” (hand-painted by Chinese artisans) across the floor of Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall—and Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn (1995), in which he destroyed the eponymous cultural artifact. Urns are frequent motifs throughout Ai’s practice, which often comments on mass consumption, individuality, censorship, and interconnections among contemporary cultures. Ai studied at the Beijing Film Academy before attending Parsons School of Design, and he has exhibited in New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Copenhagen, Beijing, London, and other cities. His work belongs in the collections of multiple institutions, including Centre Pompidou, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Tate, among others. Ai served as an artistic consultant for the design of the Bird’s Nest stadium for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

For these works, Kocks limits himself to using only black or white paper; the different layers become visible in the way the light hits the work’s surfaces, or in the way that the paper curls.

Rejecting the dominant painting and sculpting modes of his day, Warhol embraced silk-screen printmaking to achieve his characteristic hard edges and flat areas of color. The artist mentored Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and continues to influence contemporary art around the world: His provocative successors include Richard Prince, Takashi Murakami, and Jeff Koons. Warhol has been the subject of exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern, and Centre Pompidou, among other institutions.

Entirely self-taught, REWA first grabbed attention with her 14-piece of body of work, “The Pantheon” (2016) which portrayed female African goddesses as beautiful, colorful, and inviting, with the intention of overturning what she saw as the West African tendency to denigrate and reject their own deities. She has since focused on female-centered narratives in order to explore aspects of Igbo culture. Onyinye (God’s Gift) (2020) painted in REWA’s trademark stained glass aesthetic is one in a series of portraits focusing on the significance of naming rites. REWA describes her paintings as Igbo Vernacular Art and considers them an original body of work that exists outside formal academic or Western characterization. Education is an integral part of her practice as she seeks to inform both viewers and herself about the rich traditions and beliefs of Igbo culture.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch11\artsy-0000501.jpg,Painting,OOA GALLERY (Out of Africa Gallery),

artsy-0000505.jpg,1951,Henri Laurens,11-04-2023,Description,"Henri Laurens began his career creating wood and polychrome plaster sculptures, drawing on the tenets of Cubism and adopting such typically Cubist subjects as dissected human figures, guitars, and still lifes. For instance, Clown (1915), which drew on Pablo Picassos’s assemblages, consists of juxtaposed spheres, cones, and cylinders. As his career progressed, Laurens shifted toward subtler low-relief terracottas, eventually forsaking his fragmented geometric style in favor of a more natural, curvilinear one. He became known for highly abstract, rhythmic female nudes, often reclining or bathing, made from stone or bronze. Works such as La Grande Sirène (1945) and Amphion (1952) reinterpret themes from Greco-Roman mythology; Laurens approached his sculptures with a vague notion of how they should look, but increasingly succumbed to subconscious inspiration. Besides sculpting, he was also prolific in collage, printmaking, and illustration.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch11\artsy-0000505.jpg,Books and Portfolios,Forum Auctions,

Inspired by manga cartoons like Fujiko Fujio’s “Doraemon” series, Hashizume favors bold lines and simple, flat planes of color, a style that reflects his past work in advertising and which also focuses attention on his subjects’ facial expressions. Hashizume’s illustrations explore themes like the artifice of intimacy and the suppression of sadness in a hyper-paced world.

After studying at Kyoto University of the Arts in her native Japan, Kawai moved to New York in 2000, where she developed her take on heta-uma, an illustrative style rooted in manga that roughly translates from Japanese to mean “bad but good.” Kawai promoted her early work by selling zines and drawings on city streets, and gradually became known for her charming and joyful body of work. Her pieces often center on goofy characters, from amorphous cherries to friendly felines, and incorporate multimedia elements like fluffy pompoms.

Using a technique of pouring diluted oil paint onto a canvas in layers, she sometimes experimented with variations of a single hue and at other times created a purposeful interplay of different tones, as in The Song of the Wind (1977). Baber referred to her attempts to relay feelings through color as a “color hunger,” and exploration of “the infinite range of possibilities.” A member of the cooperative March Gallery in downtown New York, where she held her first solo exhibition in 1958, Baber was married to noted Abstract Expressionist painter Paul Jenkins.

The artist places his pictures in custom frames that feature borders inset with commercial goods such as cans of tomato sauce or motor oil. Thanks to his expansive approach to medium and inventive juxtapositions of North African culture and Western iconography, Hajjaj has garnered comparisons to iconoclasts and Pop phenoms such as Andy Warhol. He has exhibited in New York, London, Paris, Marrakesh, Dubai, Berlin, and Los Angeles.

During formal study at the Danish School of Design in Copenhagen in the late 1980s, Geertsen also apprenticed for a ceramist; it was within these years that he developed an extensive understanding of sculptural forms and traditional, wheel-based pottery practice. In Geertsen’s early work, basic geometric forms were thrown to his pottery wheel, producing sliced, rearranged, and staggered vessels, which were unified by a monochromatic glaze. Geertsen has also experimented with organic shapes and various patterned surfaces (from camouflage and animal skin to mirrored platinum) and expanded his oeuvre to wall hangings and architectural spaces. Despite the variations and modifications, Geertsen’s assemblages maintain a consistent motif—movement—depicted through the rhythm and repetition of his pulsating vessels.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch12\artsy-0000559.jpg,Design/Decorative Art,Køppe Contemporary Objects,7000
artsy-0000560.jpg,2022,Richard Mosse,11-04-2023,Description,"Photographer and filmmaker Richard Mosse makes lush, cinematic images that capture human destruction in natural environments. His practice straddles photojournalism and fine art, and he is best known for “Infra,” a series of luridly colored, large-scale photographs of the fighters, inhabitants, and landscapes of the Congo. By shooting with Kodak Aerochrome—a discontinued infrared surveillance film that transforms greens into acid pinks and reds—Mosse has offered a searing, psychedelic vision of the warscape and its suffering inhabitants. In 2014, the series earned Mosse the prestigious Deutsche Börse Prize. The artist received his MFA in photography from Yale in 2008 and has since exhibited at The Bass, Foam Fotografiemuseum, and Tate Modern, among other institutions. In 2013, Mosse represented Ireland at the Venice Biennale. In 2017, he was the recipient of the Prix Pictet award for his heat-map photographs of a Greek refugee camp, which he captured using a military-grade surveillance camera.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch12\artsy-0000560.jpg,Photography,Jack Shainman Gallery,7500

She renders her subjects in confrontational and pinup poses, situating them in fantastical landscapes or beneath dramatic skies. Yuskavage’s compositions recall Surrealist scenes, yet they embrace a more transgressive, contemporary edge. The artist received her MFA from the Yale School of Art and has exhibited in New York, London, Mexico City, Paris, Milan, and Los Angeles. Her work belongs in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Long Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, and has sold for more than $1 million at auction.

His early bronze sculptures of anguished human figures incorporated impressions made by machines as well as found objects, synthesizing them to evoke new associations. This later developed into a new process of piecing together works from prefabricated aluminum and brass casting molds; the resulting geometric human forms have often been described as “totems for the technological age.” Crucially, Paolozzi came to embrace technology rather than perceiving it as a demon to be feared, and wrote and lectured extensively on how popular culture and science should inform sculpture. He is often cited as an important exponent of Surrealism in Great Britain, as well as an influence on Pop Art.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch12\artsy-0000568.jpg,Print,Forum Auctions,

artsy-0000572.jpg,2023,Audra Weaser,11-04-2023,Description,"The inspiration for Audra Weaser’s abstract landscapes comes from the Southern California terrain of her upbringing, particularly her memories of the transitions between mountains, ocean, and desert. Weaser studied abstract, non-objective painting, though her earliest works were sanded wall sculptures. Her best-known body of paintings borrows from both approaches. She begins each work by applying layers of color to wood panel, and then covers the surface in an overlay of white paint. Later, she sands away the layers—a process she calls “excavation”—to create compositions that resemble reflections of forests on water. Weaser explains: “The trees reflecting on a watery plain reveal a shimmering version rather than a solid fact. My paintings are a desire to . . . reconnect to the unseen as a resonating poetic experience.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch12\artsy-0000572.jpg,Painting,JoAnne Artman Gallery,28500

The gaze of Miller’s subjects in works such as Flowers on Her Shoulder (2020) or September (2019) is direct and confrontational, but also vulnerable, suggestive of great internal grief and self-reflection. In lieu of live models, Miller paints from a library of reference images, sometimes creating composite images from multiple sources and portraying faces which are utterly unique but who represent a shared universal experience. Working directly with her fingers instead of a brush, Miller paints on paper-covered canvas, applying layer after layer of acrylic paint and transparent glaze; this process imbues her images with textural depth and an aged quality reminiscent of Renaissance portraiture.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch13\artsy-0000577.jpg,Painting,GALLERI RAMFJORD,14000

Her abstracted portraits display clear influences from cubism, expressionism, fauvism, and street art, while her use of color to deconstruct faces can be compared to works by Francis Bacon and Jenny Saville.

artsy-0000616.jpg,1975,Roberto Matta,11-04-2023,Description,"Roberto Matta’s phantasmagorical, large-scale paintings bridged the figurative dreamscapes of Surrealism and the emotive gestures of Abstract Expressionism. The artist’s vivid, imposing canvases feature a melange of geometric and biomorphic shapes that occasionally cohere into representational forms. Matta often employed multiple perspectives to keep his compositions fluid and dynamic, and his style influenced artists including Jackson Pollock and Robert Motherwell. He studied architecture and interior design in his native Chile, then developed his signature style on trips to Europe and the United States, during which he met artists such as Arshile Gorky and Salvador Dalí. Matta’s work has been exhibited widely in cities including New York, London, Santiago, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo, and Rome and belongs in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Tate, the Guggenheim Museum, and Moderna Museet, among many others.

Born in Japan but raised in Tanzania, Sato was exposed to a broad spectrum of cultures, communities, and languages throughout his early life which has led to his desire to explore the influence of culture and class on the human condition throughout his work.

He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky For the Love of God (2007), a human skull studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire. Since 1988, when the artist developed and curated “Freeze,” a groundbreaking exhibition of his work and that of his Goldsmiths College peers, he has been the subject of major shows at Tate Modern in London, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In 2008, Hirst controversially staged “Beautiful Inside my Head Forever,” an auction in which he sold his work directly to the public and raked in around $200 million for himself.

He initially mocks up many of his canvases using virtual reality modeling software (an update from Photoshop, which he used earlier in his career) and 3D prints many of his sculptures in bronze and plastic. Lee then recreates a distinctly digital aesthetic with airbrush and paintbrush. Working at small and large scales, the artist saturates his work with glowing, electric hues. Humans, animals, and hybrid creatures are frequent motifs, and Lee understands his compositions and hand-painted structures as animated representations of his own feelings. He studied at the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia before receiving his MFA from Yale in 2013.

Rejecting the dominant painting and sculpting modes of his day, Warhol embraced silk-screen printmaking to achieve his characteristic hard edges and flat areas of color. The artist mentored Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and continues to influence contemporary art around the world: His provocative successors include Richard Prince, Takashi Murakami, and Jeff Koons.

He sees the process of art-making as a negotiation of opposites, in which control meets chance, the utilitarian meets the purely aesthetic, and historical references and materials merge with contemporary times. “In making my work I design systems and then use unstable materials that…allow random and irrational things to happen,” he explains. “These…systems are rational and reasonable…frameworks within which the amorphous and the impractical flourish, creating unstable perspectives.” In sculptures composed of modern, functional, metal armatures, for example, Hagen creates precariously balanced, fragile shapes, which he sometimes combines with hunks of rainbow obsidian, a material much more solid in appearance that evokes references to geological time and ancient civilizations.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch15\artsy-0000738.jpg,Painting,Visual Artists Group,38000

The artist places his pictures in custom frames that feature borders inset with commercial goods such as cans of tomato sauce or motor oil. Thanks to his expansive approach to medium and inventive juxtapositions of North African culture and Western iconography, Hajjaj has garnered comparisons to iconoclasts and Pop phenoms such as Andy Warhol.

Kahn’s signature landscapes took inspiration from the palettes of Henri Matisse and the ethos of his Vermont farm: He painted weathered barns, undulating pastures, and tree lines that embraced a spare, evocative New England aesthetic. Kahn studied under Hans Hofmann and cited Mark Rothko, J.M.W. Turner, and Pierre Bonnard as additional influences.

Death, parenthood, sexuality, the unconscious, and explicit and violent portrayals of women as femmes fatales are recurring motifs in his oeuvre. Originating in his own imagination and traumatic life experiences, the nightmarish imagery also stems from writings by Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Edgar Allen Poe, many of which Kubin illustrated. Stylistically linked with Symbolism and Expressionism and known for a delicate, atmospheric ink wash technique, Kubin was influenced by the macabre aquatints of Francisco de Goya, Odilon Redon, James Ensor, and Max Klinger. However, he shifted to producing frenetically rendered, reality-based drawings with watercolor accents, sparked by a realization that life’s mysteries “lie not only in the bizarre, exalted, or comic moments...but [also in] the painful, the indifferent, and the incidental commonplace.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch15\artsy-0000745.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Galerie St. Etienne,20500

Influenced by the first generation of Abstract Expressionists, he sought a style even further removed from mimesis and preoccupied entirely with surface, color, and medium. Beginning with drawing and a schema, he would build layers of abstraction to explore spirituality and eroticism through paint, altogether eschewing narrative content or figuration.

artsy-0000751.jpg,2019,Yukimasa Ida,11-04-2023,Description,"Submitted by Mariane Ibrahim Gallery.
Yukimasa Ida works between abstraction and realism to create paintings infused with nostalgia. His practice relies on the concept of “ICHI-GO ICHI-E (a once in a lifetime moment).” His specific approach of distorting figuration creates a formal ambiguity and a conceptual singularity. His paintings are done in accordance with the rules of shape and color theory. The paint hangs from the canvas with a thickness that invites the viewer to take a closer look, while the exorbitant complimentary colors mix to project subversive futuristic and wistful moments. At the same time, the artist’s gesture is deeply impregnated of the “ICHI-GO ICHI-E” cultural concept that leads him questioning the subtleties of existence. After visualizing the “now” which won’t happen again, he projects this present moment on the canvas thus conferring to each of his paintings a very unique dimension.
Yukimasa Ida graduated in 2019 with a Masters in Oil Painting from Tokyo University of the Arts. He has exhibited across Japan, and abroad in Europe at spaces including Fabien Fryns Fine Art (London, U.K.), and Kaikai Kiki Gallery (Tokyo, Japan). Ida won the CAF Special Jury Award (2016), and the Arts in Marunouchi Grand Prix (2015).",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch15\artsy-0000751.jpg,Painting,Masters & Contemporary,

He studied at the Croydon School of Art, where he became interested in the Situationists and met Malcolm McLaren, who would later become the Sex Pistols’ manager.

The gaze of Miller’s subjects in works such as Flowers on Her Shoulder (2020) or September (2019) is direct and confrontational, but also vulnerable, suggestive of great internal grief and self-reflection. In lieu of live models, Miller paints from a library of reference images, sometimes creating composite images from multiple sources and portraying faces which are utterly unique but who represent a shared universal experience. Working directly with her fingers instead of a brush, Miller paints on paper-covered canvas, applying layer after layer of acrylic paint and transparent glaze; this process imbues her images with textural depth and an aged quality reminiscent of Renaissance portraiture.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch16\artsy-0000790.jpg,Painting,GALLERI RAMFJORD,6500

Ghadyanloo, who studied painting and animation in college, initially gained acclaim for his large-scale public murals in Tehran.

The artist places his pictures in custom frames that feature borders inset with commercial goods such as cans of tomato sauce or motor oil. Thanks to his expansive approach to medium and inventive juxtapositions of North African culture and Western iconography, Hajjaj has garnered comparisons to iconoclasts and Pop phenoms such as Andy Warhol.

Hockney first gained recognition for his semi-abstract paintings of gay love. He moved to California in 1964 and captured his new home in sensual, pastel-hued scenes of uninhibited queer men whose idyllic, sunny backdrops feature swimming pools, palm trees, and light, beautiful homes. Hockney has exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Royal Academy of Arts in London, and the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, among many other institutions.

His style references the sensuality and glossy flatness of pin-ups and Playboy spreads and has drawn the ire of feminists and art critics alike, despite Ramos’s assertion that his works are “apolitical”.

While Doorsen’s visual language is decidedly abstract and emphasizes pattern and color, it is also grounded in familiar, expression-based calligraphic marks. Her use of materials like tissue paper and wax is reminiscent of Arte Povera in that she imbues old objects with a new purpose.

Beard imbues his artistic alter egos with complex biographies and individual styles, a conceit that allows him to explore the styles of German Expressionism, Impressionism, Postmodernism, and other genres. His most recognized persona is that of Bruce Sargeant, a fictional 20th-century British painter whose homoerotic works celebrated an idolized male physique. Named after John Singer Sargent, Beard’s character was created as a way to insert an explicitly queer agenda into the (predominantly heteronormative or closeted) art historical canon. At times his works are controversial, as in the case of his Basquiat-like persona Peter Coulter, which has drawn criticism for its use of blackface.

artsy-0000853.jpg,1998,Mark Stock,11-04-2023,Description,"Tinged with a jaded air of mystery and melancholy, the paintings of Mark Stock depict a world of doomed romance and illicit desire populated by characters seemingly drawn from 1930s detective thrillers or film noir of the 1940s. Stock’s work skillfully employs color, shadow, and line to create brooding effects of mood and tension, while subtly using facial expression, body language, and background to reveal compelling narrative elements. Filled with images of clandestine trysts, voyeuristic impulses, illicit affairs, and unrequited love, Stock’s work is unapologetically melodramatic, evoking a world of frustrated desire and ultimate loneliness, albeit one colored by the artist’s darkly acerbic sense of humor. Beginning his career as a lithographer, Stock made prints for artists such as Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, David Hockney, and Roy Lichtenstein before turning to painting.

After studying at the Art Students League in New York—where he adopted a figurative style inspired by Social Realism—and at the Académie de la Grand Chaumière in Paris, Held embraced the gestural approach of New York’s Abstract Expressionist scene. He found mentors in Mark Rothko and Franz Kline. In the late 1960s, Held began to challenge the flatness of many modernist painting styles, breaking up the picture plane with suggestions of deep space and three-dimensional form. He worked exclusively in black and white for nearly a decade before reintroducing eye-popping color into his canvases.

He is particularly well known for his large-scale public installations, the largest of which is Momentum (2008) in Singapore. Gerstein’s work from the 1970s focused on figurative paintings and watercolors depicting scenes from his childhood. A recurring bicycle motif in these works reappears in later pieces. Steel-cut figures first appeared in his art in the early 1980s and they continue to assist him in illustrating everything from childhood to the natural world. These themes can be seen in Nature Lover (ca. 2020), with a bicycle in silhouette combined with a burst of brightly colored butterflies that surround and follow the rider. Gerstein continues to work in paint, creating brightly colored compositions such as 20.13 (2020) that meet his desire to speak to the art world while remaining accessible to the public.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch17\artsy-0000874.jpg,Painting,Clarendon Fine Art,8350

Using a technique of pouring diluted oil paint onto a canvas in layers, she sometimes experimented with variations of a single hue and at other times created a purposeful interplay of different tones, as in The Song of the Wind (1977). Baber referred to her attempts to relay feelings through color as a “color hunger,” and exploration of “the infinite range of possibilities.” A member of the cooperative March Gallery in downtown New York, where she held her first solo exhibition in 1958, Baber was married to noted Abstract Expressionist painter Paul Jenkins.

Beard imbues his artistic alter egos with complex biographies and individual styles, a conceit that allows him to explore the styles of German Expressionism, Impressionism, Postmodernism, and other genres. His most recognized persona is that of Bruce Sargeant, a fictional 20th-century British painter whose homoerotic works celebrated an idolized male physique. Named after John Singer Sargent, Beard’s character was created as a way to insert an explicitly queer agenda into the (predominantly heteronormative or closeted) art historical canon. At times his works are controversial, as in the case of his Basquiat-like persona Peter Coulter, which has drawn criticism for its use of blackface.

Early in his career, Kounellis took inspiration from artists including Alberto Burri, Lucio Fontana, Jackson Pollock, and Franz Kline—experimental painters who pushed the boundaries of their own medium. Indeed, even as his work grew less painterly, Kounellis insisted he was a painter above all else. He has been the subject of retrospectives at the Whitechapel Gallery, the Museo Reina Sofía, the Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Moderna in Rome, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, among other institutions.

""I wanted to show how good I look,” Fosso has noted about these early pictures, referencing his practice of dressing up in bell bottoms, disco boots, hotpants, and other costume attire for his self-portraits.

He briefly worked in a Cubist mode and helped spur movements including Dada and Conceptualism. Though his practice spanned drawing, painting, and installation, Duchamp is perhaps most famous for his “readymade” sculptures: pieces composed of prefabricated objects such as a urinal, a shovel, or a bicycle wheel affixed to a wooden stool, which the artist situated in the middle of the exhibition space. Duchamp saw the readymade as an opportunity to free art from traditional confines of taste and beauty. He studied at Académie Julian before becoming involved in the avant-garde circles of New York and Paris. Duchamp also played tournament chess and, in the last decades of his life, worked in secret on a final installation, Étant donnés (1946–66). His pieces have sold for up to eight figures on the secondary market and belong in the collections of countless institutions, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, the Staatliches Museum Schwerin, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch18\artsy-0000913.jpg,Other,Larkin Erdmann,7000

Vostell has exhibited widely around the world and participated in the sixth edition of Documenta in 1977. Working amid the rise of performance-based art in postwar Germany, he was a pioneer of conceptual art and a leading German proponent of Happenings and _Dé-coll/age_—an expansion of collage that included events, installations, images, and destructive processes meant to tear down outworn customs and values. Much of Vostell’s work incorporates two of the most salient symbols of postwar consumer culture: the television and the automobile. He is also known for embedding objects in concrete, as in his 1970 work Concrete Traffic, a durational sculpture in which he encased a 1957 Cadillac DeVille in the material.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch18\artsy-0000916.jpg,Mixed Media,Galerie aKonzept,

Rokkaku began painting in 2002 and her big break arrived in 2006, when she was awarded the prestigious Akio Goto Prize at Kaikai Kiki’s Geisai art fair. Since then, she has exhibited at galleries in Paris, Tokyo, and Amsterdam, and in 2015, she participated in the Swatch Art Pavilion’s Open Studio at the Venice Biennale.

Once dry, the artist peels off these shapes—each one unique and hand-crafted—and layers them onto canvas or paper to create his highly-textured pieces.

Working with pencil, ink, ballpoint pen, crayon, and paint on paper, he makes abstract drawings that vary from spare to maximalist. For some of his largest compositions, he uses only a ballpoint pen, working line-by-line to build up forms that sweep across the page and resemble the undulating, striated surfaces of rock formations. By contrast, some of his smaller works feature only a handful of marks, which float delicately in the center of an otherwise blank page. Describing his practice, Müller has said, “Attraction and repulsion, breathing in and breathing out, vigor and laxity are poles between which my work oscillates. . . . My work generates its energy and vitality precisely from these polarities and tensions.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch19\artsy-0000967.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Kristof De Clercq gallery,

Amalgamation (2018) reflects Sato’s use of expressive interiors and a harmonious color palette painted in a geometric style, revealing his interest in the design principles of the Old Masters. Born in Japan but raised in Tanzania, Sato was exposed to a broad spectrum of cultures, communities, and languages throughout his early life which has led to his desire to explore the influence of culture and class on the human condition throughout his work.

The resulting sculptures are brought to life by the work of his chisel, creating gradations of highlights and shadows and lightly painted surfaces. Early examples of his work—male or female nudes attached to pedestals—echoed classical Greek statues; their carefully positioned features (the geometry of the lip, the curve of the eyebrow) and extraordinarily life-like relaxed postures belie their apparent simplicity. More recent works feature unremarkably dressed contemporary figures, rendered with enough detail to almost suggest three-dimensional portraiture. However, showing no signs of emotion and bearing no socio-critical references, they retain considerable banality. “I’m perhaps proposing a story and not telling the end, just giving a beginning or fragment.

artsy-0000976.jpg,2007,Damien Hirst,11-04-2023,Description,"Damien Hirst, a poster boy for the Young British Artists who rose to prominence in late 1980s London, is one of the most notorious artists of his generation. He has pushed the limits of fine art and good taste with sculptures that comprise dead animals submerged in formaldehyde; innumerable spot paintings that appear mass-produced and can sell for millions of dollars; and the exuberantly tacky For the Love of God (2007), a human skull studded with 8,601 diamonds. Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire. Since 1988, when the artist developed and curated “Freeze,” a groundbreaking exhibition of his work and that of his Goldsmiths College peers, he has been the subject of major shows at Tate Modern in London, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In 2008, Hirst controversially staged “Beautiful Inside my Head Forever,” an auction in which he sold his work directly to the public and raked in around $200 million for himself.

Beard imbues his artistic alter egos with complex biographies and individual styles, a conceit that allows him to explore the styles of German Expressionism, Impressionism, Postmodernism, and other genres. His most recognized persona is that of Bruce Sargeant, a fictional 20th-century British painter whose homoerotic works celebrated an idolized male physique. Named after John Singer Sargent, Beard’s character was created as a way to insert an explicitly queer agenda into the (predominantly heteronormative or closeted) art historical canon. At times his works are controversial, as in the case of his Basquiat-like persona Peter Coulter, which has drawn criticism for its use of blackface. Beard’s paintings, prints, and sculptural works are included in the MoMA and Whitney Museum collections as well as at Harvard and Yale universities.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch19\artsy-0000977.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",CLAMP,1000

Cotton paints from life, constructing elaborate models using real baked goods and other confectionery, from which he derives the fantastical environments depicted in his large-scale canvases. Cotton’s work has been interpreted as a criticism of the greed and the overindulgence of American society, as well as a contemporary re-imagination of traditional genres such as landscape and portraiture. Cotton has also directed his creative energies toward the realm of popular culture, acting as art director for Katy Perry’s California Gurls (2010) music video and depicting the singer in a series of paintings.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch19\artsy-0000978.jpg,Print,Pace Prints,20000

Drawing from disparate cultural sources—which range from Marcel Proust and William Blake to the Bible—the artist makes cartoon-inspired ink drawings on paper which evoke the aesthetics of fanzines and concert flyers. Baseball players, trains, crashing waves, political figures, and comic book characters make frequent appearances, often accompanied by cryptic, ironic snippets of handwritten text. Pettibon has been the subject of solo shows at the New Museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, and the Kunsthalle Wien. He has exhibited at the Venice Biennale, Documenta, and the Whitney Biennial, where he was the recipient of the Bucksbaum Award in 2004.

Keyes, however, does not place his animal subjects in their natural settings; rather, they are often in peril, displaced from their natural ecosystems into dioramic fantastical situations. These landscapes are frequently isolated and contain an incompatible mix of the natural and manmade.

He initially studied watercolor painting and later switched to oils, teaching himself how to work with the latter material. He concentrates on urban and natural landscapes and the human figure, rendering his subjects in a naturalistic, impressionistic style. Lorusso is especially interested in painting ordinary people in everyday settings, which he invests with a sense of pathos and mystery. Through his work, he aims to connect to others by conveying universal human experiences. “I believe truly great art serves as a trigger into something deeper within all of us,” he says.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch19\artsy-0001023.jpg,Painting,Bonner David Galleries,4500

Calder was an international phenomenon during his lifetime. He won the grand prize for sculpture at the 1952 Venice Biennale, where he represented the United States. He earned the French Legion of Honor and the American Presidential Medal of Freedom, among other honors. Calder has been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, the Rijksmuseum, the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, and the Museo Reina Sofía.

After settling in the Central African Republic, he made a living taking wedding portraits and passport pictures, and began using the leftover frames to take self-portraits, at first to send to his grandmother in Nigeria. ""I wanted to show how good I look,” Fosso has noted about these early pictures, referencing his practice of dressing up in bell bottoms, disco boots, hotpants, and other costume attire for his self-portraits.

He bridged the gap between the art world and the street, graffiting city subways and sidewalks before committing to a studio practice. Haring united the appeal of cartoons with the raw energy of Art Brut artists such as Jean DuBuffet as he developed a distinct pop-graffiti aesthetic that comprised energetic, boldly outlined figures against solid or patterned backdrops. His major themes included exploitation, subjugation, drug abuse, and the threat of nuclear holocaust; Haring boldly engaged with social issues, especially after receiving an AIDS diagnosis in 1987.

Along with Joan Miró, he explored automatic drawing, seeking to express the creative force of the unconscious. This led to images—like the celebrated Battle of the Fishes (1927), a poetic depiction of conflict and metamorphosis with undertones of primordial eroticism—derived from random gestures and drawn spontaneously in glue, then sprinkled with colored sands for added texture and complexity. His signature violence, evident in the terrifying, fragmented figures of In The Tower of Sleep (1938), reflects the horrors of the Spanish Civil War and WWII, as well as his own troubled psyche in the aftermath of his service in WWI.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch19\artsy-0001033.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Riva Advisory,

In his “Light Ballets,” he projected light through perforated globes, columns, and other materials. For nearly 20 years, Piene served as the director of the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 2008, he co-founded the International ZERO Foundation with Heinz Mack and Günther Uecker to archive documents, projects, and images produced by Group Zero. Piene’s work has sold for six figures at auction and belongs in the collections of the Neue Nationalgalerie, the Centre Pompidou, the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Stedelijk Museum, and the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch21\artsy-0001069.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Ludorff,

artsy-0001071.jpg,2021,Hunter Potter,11-04-2023,Description,"Hunter Potter uses a bold color palette and whimsical, geometric figures inspired by American folklore to create poppy paintings that celebrate the minutiae of daily life on a monumental scale. Potter’s characters often draw on subjects on the fringe of society; the cowboy is a recurring motif, perhaps questioning what it means to be a man in contemporary American society. More often than not, as in Not A Care In The World (2020), these paintings simply encourage the viewer to stop and appreciate the here and now. Potter’s figures often feature society’s underdogs; the criminals, fighters, and runaways he associates his work with are similar to characters in novels by John Steinbeck, Ernest Hemingway, and Wallace Stegner, whose writing influences Potter’s work. Although he continues to create more intimate work, the artist’s enthusiasm for large scale works began when he was apprenticed to paint billboards in New York. Potter was the recipient of the Roger Smith Artist Fellowship at the Vermont Studio Center in 2018 and was awarded residencies in London at the Plop Residency and The Fores Project.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch21\artsy-0001071.jpg,Painting,3 White Dots,10000
artsy-0001072.jpg,1958,Andy Warhol,11-04-2023,Description,"Obsessed with celebrity, consumer culture, and mechanical reproduction, Pop artist Andy Warhol created some of the 20th century’s most iconic images. He drew widely from popular culture and everyday subject matter in his most famous works: his 32 Campbell's soup cans, Brillo pad box sculptures, and portraits of Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, for example. Rejecting the dominant painting and sculpting modes of his day, Warhol embraced silk-screen printmaking to achieve his characteristic hard edges and flat areas of color. The artist mentored Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and continues to influence contemporary art around the world: His provocative successors include Richard Prince, Takashi Murakami, and Jeff Koons. Warhol has been the subject of exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern, and Centre Pompidou, among other institutions.

His work is informed by his own experience moving from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Cape Town, South Africa. Working primarily with oil paint, Luzumba frequently depicts his figures participating in leisurely activities, like playing chess or sharing a drink. The men in his paintings are often dressed in suits, a nod to the DRC’s reversal of a ban on Western attire, and the sense of freedom that accompanies the use of fashion to express defiance. In ELEGANCE (who is following who?) (2021) three well-dressed figures adorned in Oxford shirts and loafers walk as though they are floating against a deep green background; this painting’s air of normalcy contrasts with works such as Gold Digger (2019), which are more overtly critical of corruption.

By shooting with Kodak Aerochrome—a discontinued infrared surveillance film that transforms greens into acid pinks and reds—Mosse has offered a searing, psychedelic vision of the warscape and its suffering inhabitants. In 2014, the series earned Mosse the prestigious Deutsche Börse Prize. The artist received his MFA in photography from Yale in 2008 and has since exhibited at The Bass, Foam Fotografiemuseum, and Tate Modern, among other institutions. In 2013, Mosse represented Ireland at the Venice Biennale. In 2017, he was the recipient of the Prix Pictet award for his heat-map photographs of a Greek refugee camp, which he captured using a military-grade surveillance camera.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch21\artsy-0001129.jpg,Photography,Jack Shainman Gallery,20000

Cotton paints from life, constructing elaborate models using real baked goods and other confectionery, from which he derives the fantastical environments depicted in his large-scale canvases. Cotton’s work has been interpreted as a criticism of the greed and the overindulgence of American society, as well as a contemporary re-imagination of traditional genres such as landscape and portraiture. Cotton has also directed his creative energies toward the realm of popular culture, acting as art director for Katy Perry’s California Gurls (2010) music video and depicting the singer in a series of paintings.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch21\artsy-0001136.jpg,Painting,Templon,150000

Inspired by African and Iberian art, he also contributed to the rise of Surrealism and Expressionism. Picasso’s sizable oeuvre grew to include over 20,000 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures, ceramics, theater sets, and costume designs. He painted his most famous work, Guernica (1937), in response to the Spanish Civil War; the totemic grisaille canvas remains a definitive work of anti-war art. At auction, a number of Picasso’s paintings have sold for more than $100 million.

He drew widely from popular culture and everyday subject matter in his most famous works: his 32 Campbell's soup cans, Brillo pad box sculptures, and portraits of Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, for example. Rejecting the dominant painting and sculpting modes of his day, Warhol embraced silk-screen printmaking to achieve his characteristic hard edges and flat areas of color. The artist mentored Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and continues to influence contemporary art around the world: His provocative successors include Richard Prince, Takashi Murakami, and Jeff Koons. Warhol has been the subject of exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern, and Centre Pompidou, among other institutions.

De Blauwer studied fashion design at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp. She created her first collages as mood boards for her fashion collections; although she eventually left the field, she remained drawn to the process of combining disparate images to create cinematic narratives. Centering on anonymous female figures, De Blauwer’s collages critique the stereotypical depictions of women in media and reveal her own complex feelings surrounding identity, sexuality, and the female body. Disembodied torsos, hands, or legs are fragmented by solid blocks of color, their faces cut out of the frame or otherwise obscured.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch22\artsy-0001147.jpg,Photography,Galerie Les filles du calvaire,

artsy-0001154.jpg,1961,Marcello Mariani,11-04-2023,Description,"Born in Italy in 1938, painter Marcello Mariani was greatly influenced by New York City’s booming Post-War art scene, which notably included the Abstract Expressionists. Mariani also took on a great deal of inspiration from European artists like Piet Mondrian, Josef Albers and Hans Hofmann, whose work, which often focused on theories regarding the relationship between colors, are a clear influence for Mariani. In the ‘60s, Robert Rauschenberg—who was spending time in Rome—helped form Mariani’s ideas surrounding the potential of abstraction, and a 1974 collaboration with the artist Joseph Beuys pushed the conceptual rigor of his work. Studio Mariani Gallery in L'aquila, Italy—about 75 miles east of Rome—is an art space designed by Mariani which began unofficially in the ‘70s and ‘80s when Mariani would reserve space in his studio to display the work of his friends and fellow artists.

Reminiscent of textiles and wallpaper, her images navigate a tension between the soft arts of the domestic space and the vigor of traditional gestural abstraction—a middle point between the masculine and feminine as traditionally considered in art history.

Matsutani’s work is regularly represented in major Gutai exhibitions and was featured in the International Art Exhibition at the 2017 Venice Biennale. Today, he is one of the most widely represented Gutai artists on the market, due to the longevity of his career and his prolific output. Throughout his career he has continuously adopted new materials and techniques to push the boundaries of his practice. In the 1960s, inspired by Gutai founder Jirō Yoshihara’s principle of doing what has never been done before, Matsutani began using blown air and vinyl glue —then a newly developed material —to create bulbous, sensual reliefs on canvas. His later mural-sized graphite and pencil works on paper feature sweeping, gestural strokes that create broad “bands of blackness,” as several of his exhibitions have been titled.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch22\artsy-0001162.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Repetto Gallery,

Among his better-known series are a number of works dedicated to the Tower of Babel and fantastical architecture (2001-2006), and a humorous and fantastical body of self-portraits (2000-2002).

She combines painting and sewing, often applying and stitching cut canvas fragments to her works. In 2014, Munroe received her undergraduate degree from the European Academy of Art in Brittany, and two years later, her graduate degree from Central Saint Martins in London. Her ebullient pieces have garnered her a strong following on Instagram, where she shares glimpses of her process, which sometimes involves her standing atop large-scale canvases to paint. While most of Munroe’s paintings magnify and revel in the organic forms of familiar objects, she has also incorporated texts. These words, rendered in childlike script, add another layer of playfulness to her textured still lifes.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch22\artsy-0001191.jpg,Painting,Rafael Pérez Hernando Arte Contemporáneo,

artsy-0001193.jpg,1994,Patrick Procktor,11-04-2023,Description,"Figurative British painter Patrick Procktor worked with oil paints, thin acrylic washes, and watercolors to create portraits of friends like David Hockney and romantic landscapes based on his extensive travels in Venice, Mumbai, China, and Japan. Procktor studied painting at the Slade School of Fine Art under Keith Vaughan and William Coldstream, and later had a breakthrough first exhibition at London’s Redfern Gallery in 1963, which famously sold out before opening. The following year, Procktor participated in the “New Generation” show at Whitechapel Gallery alongside Bridget Riley, John Hoyland, and Hockney. Procktor’s use of the out-of-vogue medium of watercolor likely contributed to his lack of commercial success in later years, and his oil and acrylic paintings tend to be more sought after, such as Still life with flowers in a jug, on a table top which sold at a 2021 auction for £43,750.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch22\artsy-0001193.jpg,Print,Forum Auctions,

While his contemporaries practiced traditional lettering, Futura combined text, imagery, thin aerosol lines, swaths of vibrant color, and a distinctive use of white space as he created dynamic, futuristic compositions; science fiction and computing technology have long informed his aesthetic. In the 1980s—alongside fellow artists Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Kenny Scharf—Futura began exhibiting works on canvas in fine art gallery settings. In the ensuing decades, he’s exhibited at such institutions as the New Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and his work has sold for six figures at auction.

These paintings are based on photographs taken by the artist, who explained he was drawn to subjects who appeared out of place, alienated, or awkward. In the more recent paintings from the series, Amory began to eliminate parts of the architecture or scenery to heighten the sense of isolation. He paints in a realist style characterized by gestural brushwork and the use of translucent layers of paint for a hazy effect; his palette is muted and tends towards contrasts of dark and light. While his influences vary, Amory has said that the New Topographics have been an influence, for their similar pursuit of capturing beauty in the everyday and overlooked.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch22\artsy-0001196.jpg,Painting,Jonathan LeVine Projects,9500

The artist’s bold, calligraphic, non-objective canvases evolved from an interest in rational, mathematical-based approaches to artmaking. He later shifted his approach, embracing materiality and spontaneity as he used fast-drying paints and novel application methods such as rakes and olive branches to create his explosive compositions.

In lush, somewhat satirical still lives and landscapes that employ traditional painting styles and photographic techniques, Jacobsen offers a bucolic, sublime escape from contemporary consumerism, industry, and innovation. To enhance the transporting quality of his work, Jacobsen situates his two-dimensional works in environments that incorporate sculpture and installation.

His colorful, cartoonish characters—always rendered in profile, with one bold eye looking out at the viewer—lent a vibrant, human element to the stark symbol of division. Today, segments of Noir’s Berlin Wall murals belong to art collections around the world. The French-born, Berlin-based artist has expanded his practice to include painting, printmaking, and public art. Noir has exhibited in London (where he often collaborates with local graffiti artist Stik), Los Angeles, and Berlin.

With flat underlayers that often appear to have been produced through the scraping away of paint, the works' tension lies in their contrast of surfaces: smooth is juxtaposed with rough, addition with subtraction. With titles like I Should've Gotten Your Number After the Orgy (2013) and Busty Bombshell In Pasadena (2013), Reihsen's paintings are also whimsical, alluding to narratives and ideas outside the picture frame.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch23\artsy-0001216.jpg,Painting,The Hole,20000
artsy-0001217.jpg,2023,Nick Doyle,11-04-2023,Description,"Nick Doyle is keenly aware of the legacy of the American notion of Manifest Destiny. Known best for sculptural wall works made from collaged denim, Doyle infiltrates the vocabulary of Americana to examine greed, excess, and toxic masculinity. Doyle uses the road trip—a pillar of American mythology—as a point of entry to his work in order to question the persistence of rugged individualism as the fabric of our national identity. Through a series of mechanical miniatures, theatrical scenery, and satirical, prop-like denim works, the artist foregrounds the dangers of nostalgia and our evolving relationship to consumerism. Seemingly innocuous, Doyle’s imagery (vending machine, typewriter, cigarette pack) and materials (indigo and cotton) tell a story of American colonialism and consumerism, and explore the influence of media on global trade systems. By employing materials that hold cultural significance, the artist both reflects on and critiques social and political agendas that are often at play in contemporary life and visual culture.

The artist begins each work by applying acrylic paint to wax paper, fashioning thousands of brightly-colored ovals and drips. Once dry, the artist peels off these shapes—each one unique and hand-crafted—and layers them onto canvas or paper to create his highly-textured pieces. Chacon compares this process to a social gathering, as he brings together a variety of disparate elements into a single unit. For a recent series, Chacon looked to the culture and myths of Ancient Rome, producing monochromatic paintings in deep purples and golds that reflect the society’s imperial colors.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch23\artsy-0001248.jpg,Painting,Margaret Thatcher Projects,22000

artsy-0001253.jpg,1974,Francesca Woodman,11-04-2023,Description,"Over the course of her brief career, Francesca Woodman produced haunting photographs that featured the feminine form in space. In her beguiling portraits—including many self-portraits—she captured her subjects blurred in motion or partially hidden behind furniture. Woodman’s compositions, aided by her long exposures, offer ghostly meditations on sexuality, identity, and the construction of the self. Woodman studied at the Rhode Island School of Design, where she developed her practice as she took inspiration from Surrealist photographers such as Man Ray and Claude Cahun. She did not exhibit widely before her untimely death at age 22, but her work has since been shown in New York, Zürich, Berlin, Rome, Paris, and London, and has been included in institutional shows at the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson, the Vertical Gallery of the Verbund Collection, the Guggenheim Museum, and Tate Modern, among others.

artsy-0001254.jpg,2018,Travis Louie,11-04-2023,Description,"Travis Louie is a painter and illustrator whose macabre yet beguilingly whimsical portraits depict characters from an imaginary universe inhabited by bizarre and unearthly beings, part human, part animal, part mythological being. Recalling formal photographic portraiture of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, the realism of Louie’s meticulously detailed acrylic paintings contrasts sharply with the fantastic nature of his subjects. Influenced by German Expressionist cinema, film noir, Gothic literature, 1950s Sci-Fi, and the Weird Tales of H.P. Lovecraft, Louie’s work conjures up a black-and-white world of shadowy imagination, hinting at narratives and personal histories just beyond our reach. Louie’s portraits also touch on xenophobia and prejudice towards immigrants and other marginalized groups as he grapples with issues of identity. The works reflect, in his words, a desire for a world in which fear of “the other” might be superseded by curiosity and acceptance of those who are different.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch23\artsy-0001254.jpg,Painting,Haven Gallery,5500

In early works such as Cold Fire (2008), he applied transparent lacquer to high-tech fabrics, exploring optics and perception, while in Lapetus (2010), he used retro-reflective materials to highlight the contrast between light and dark. In recent works, he has combined elemental metals like powdered copper, zinc, and oxidized iron with water to form ephemeral patterns. Lergon believes in a phenomenological approach to the experience of an artwork, maintaining that a painting’s space functions as an eigenraum, or “own space,” in which one has a personal reaction to physical matter.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch23\artsy-0001262.jpg,Painting,Galerie Christian Lethert,

His works are a combination of chaos and harmony, which, for him, reflects the balance of nature. Though their rectangular shape resembles that of traditional Chinese scroll paintings, Yinghua’s canvases are radically contemporary and subversive. To make his works, he stretches, welds, and sculpts precious metals, like pure silver, into crinkly forms, which he then affixes to the canvas in interlocking accretions, together with masses of trash. Splashes, strokes, and drips of paint complete these paradoxical pictures, through which he breaks down the distinction between trash and treasure, challenging viewers to re-assess conceptions of value and preciousness.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch26\artsy-0001297.jpg,Painting,Kristy Stubbs Gallery,35000

Ivan Arlaud’s paintings evoke the happiness of life though the warmhearted and sunny atmosphere found through his various interior scenes. Though the human figure is absent, the scenes do not lack intimacy, thanks to subtle clues, like a steaming cup of coffee, barely eaten fruit, or a book of poetry laid carelessly on an unfolded tablecloth. The painter offers us an invitation to leisure or a seat at a table. He sets the scene and leaves it to us to imagine its narrative. These interiors recall the comfort of one’s home. Through warm and vivid colors, Arlaud shows a mastery of his palette, juxtaposing shades in order to form luminous oppositions. Arlaud chooses his subjects from his daily life. He appreciates photography, and his paintings are poetic transcriptions of captured images.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch26\artsy-0001298.jpg,Painting,sobering,

Her works characteristically feature chunky and exaggerated human proportions, strong contour lines, and minimal shading—a style influenced by both folk art and modernist painting.

These paintings are based on photographs taken by the artist, who explained he was drawn to subjects who appeared out of place, alienated, or awkward. In the more recent paintings from the series, Amory began to eliminate parts of the architecture or scenery to heighten the sense of isolation. He paints in a realist style characterized by gestural brushwork and the use of translucent layers of paint for a hazy effect; his palette is muted and tends towards contrasts of dark and light.

After receiving her bachelor’s degree in printmaking from Colorado College in 1989, Kilgallen moved to the Bay Area, where she became involved in the art scene of San Francisco’s Mission District. She and her husband, fellow artist Barry McGee, painted graffiti together, tagging freight trains with their monikers Matokie Slaughter and Twist. As a bookbinder and conservator for the San Francisco Public Library, Kilgallen amassed a vast knowledge of typography, which she applied her own practice that featured meticulously hand-crafted lettering. Using a distinct palette of red, yellow, and brown paint—often in discontinued or deeply discounted colors—she produced room-sized murals featuring women surfing or biking interspersed with text in circus-like fonts.

The gaze of Miller’s subjects in works such as Flowers on Her Shoulder (2020) or September (2019) is direct and confrontational, but also vulnerable, suggestive of great internal grief and self-reflection. In lieu of live models, Miller paints from a library of reference images, sometimes creating composite images from multiple sources and portraying faces which are utterly unique but who represent a shared universal experience. Working directly with her fingers instead of a brush, Miller paints on paper-covered canvas, applying layer after layer of acrylic paint and transparent glaze; this process imbues her images with textural depth and an aged quality reminiscent of Renaissance portraiture.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch27\artsy-0001322.jpg,Painting,Hashimoto Contemporary,2000

Beginning in the mid-1920s, Benton rendered elongated forms in both vibrant palettes and striking monochrome, depicting the realities of rural life and the pressures of industrialization. His canvases often feature symbols of progress such as railroads and factories, perhaps commenting on the tensions between industrialization and agricultural labor in early 20th-century American life. Benton’s work has sold for seven figures at auction and belongs in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among others.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch27\artsy-0001326.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Alessandro Berni Gallery,10500
artsy-0001327.jpg,1960,Emilio Vedova,11-04-2023,Description,"Considered one of the most influential Italian artists of the post-war period, Emilio Vedova is renowned for his expressive and gestural abstract paintings which seem to directly respond to the tumultuous political climate of his time. Politically engaged from an early age, he joined the Milanese anti-Fascist artists’ association known as Corrente, in 1942, and co-signed the Oltre Guernica (“Beyond Guernica”) manifesto in 1946, which encouraged artists to use abstraction rather than figuration to reflect the reality of contemporary society. In works such as Del nostro tempo (1960) and Studio per sopraffazione n. 1 (1962), Vedova’s bold, gestural brushstrokes and violent smears of paint vividly convey the sense of uncertainty, unease, and rebellion which characterized the 1960s. Vedova remained restlessly inventive throughout his career: He designed stage sets and costumes for opera, immersive light collages, monotypes, and large-scale glass engravings, as well as numerous examples of his _Plurimi_—freestanding, multi-panelled painted sculptures made of wood and metal.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch27\artsy-0001327.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Koos Gallery,

Weaser studied abstract, non-objective painting, though her earliest works were sanded wall sculptures. Her best-known body of paintings borrows from both approaches. She begins each work by applying layers of color to wood panel, and then covers the surface in an overlay of white paint. Later, she sands away the layers—a process she calls “excavation”—to create compositions that resemble reflections of forests on water. Weaser explains: “The trees reflecting on a watery plain reveal a shimmering version rather than a solid fact. My paintings are a desire to . . . reconnect to the unseen as a resonating poetic experience.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch27\artsy-0001329.jpg,Painting,James May Gallery,4000

The Argentine-born, Italian-raised artist was a friend and contemporary of key members of the Surrealist movement and featured in the Museum of Modern Art’s groundbreaking “Fantastic Art, Dada and Surrealism” exhibition in 1936. While her works embrace strangeness and the uncanny, Fini refused to label herself a Surrealist due to the group’s misogynist element. Her work has been exhibited in New York, Rome, Paris, and London, and she participated in the Venice Biennale and São Paulo Biennial on multiple occasions.

artsy-0001340.jpg,1970,Ilya Bolotowsky,11-04-2023,Description,"A fervent proponent of the power of abstract art and a major figure in American abstraction, Ilya Bolotowsky created work that reflected his unceasing interest in Modernist geometry. Born in Russia, Bolotowsky arrived in New York in 1923 and quickly grew interested in biomorphic surrealism. His exposure to Piet Mondrian in the 1930s prompted him to explore the potential of hard-edged abstraction; the colorful neo-plastic paintings he began creating at this time characterized his work for the rest of his life. Fiercely committed to the avant-garde, Bolotowsky joined The Ten, a band of nine artists including Adolph Gottlieb and Mark Rothko that advocated for new forms of abstraction. Although he never embraced Abstraction Expressionism like some of his peers, he remained an influential figure, teaching such notable artists as Kenneth Noland at Black Mountain College.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch27\artsy-0001340.jpg,Painting,A.Style,2800

While her works embrace strangeness and the uncanny, Fini refused to label herself a Surrealist due to the group’s misogynist element. Her work has been exhibited in New York, Rome, Paris, and London, and she participated in the Venice Biennale and São Paulo Biennial on multiple occasions. Today, her work sells for six figures on the secondary market and belongs to the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Tate Modern, and Centre Georges Pompidou, among other institutions.

Beginning in the mid-1920s, Benton rendered elongated forms in both vibrant palettes and striking monochrome, depicting the realities of rural life and the pressures of industrialization. His canvases often feature symbols of progress such as railroads and factories, perhaps commenting on the tensions between industrialization and agricultural labor in early 20th-century American life. Benton’s work has sold for seven figures at auction and belongs in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among others.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch27\artsy-0001360.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Galería de arte Luisa Pita,

artsy-0001364.jpg,2023,Audra Weaser,11-04-2023,Description,"The inspiration for Audra Weaser’s abstract landscapes comes from the Southern California terrain of her upbringing, particularly her memories of the transitions between mountains, ocean, and desert. Weaser studied abstract, non-objective painting, though her earliest works were sanded wall sculptures. Her best-known body of paintings borrows from both approaches. She begins each work by applying layers of color to wood panel, and then covers the surface in an overlay of white paint. Later, she sands away the layers—a process she calls “excavation”—to create compositions that resemble reflections of forests on water. Weaser explains: “The trees reflecting on a watery plain reveal a shimmering version rather than a solid fact. My paintings are a desire to . . . reconnect to the unseen as a resonating poetic experience.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch27\artsy-0001364.jpg,Painting,Tumo Gallery,

In the ongoing “The Malediction of Cham” series, Plaisir draws on the Curse of Cham, or Ham, a misinterpretation of a biblical story that has been used to justify racism. Paying homage to Black activists like Nina Simone, James Baldwin, and Aretha Franklin, Plaisir portrays the celebrities against a black background; she uses a unique shade created by Plaisr from multiple elements within her palette in order to emphasize the beauty and diversity of the color. The subjects, surrounded by organic and floral motifs drawn from Plaisir’s Caribbean heritage, exemplify the vision of an oppressionless utopia.

Politically engaged from an early age, he joined the Milanese anti-Fascist artists’ association known as Corrente, in 1942, and co-signed the Oltre Guernica (“Beyond Guernica”) manifesto in 1946, which encouraged artists to use abstraction rather than figuration to reflect the reality of contemporary society. In works such as Del nostro tempo (1960) and Studio per sopraffazione n. 1 (1962), Vedova’s bold, gestural brushstrokes and violent smears of paint vividly convey the sense of uncertainty, unease, and rebellion which characterized the 1960s. Vedova remained restlessly inventive throughout his career: He designed stage sets and costumes for opera, immersive light collages, monotypes, and large-scale glass engravings, as well as numerous examples of his _Plurimi_—freestanding, multi-panelled painted sculptures made of wood and metal.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch27\artsy-0001371.jpg,"Drawing, Collage or other Work on Paper",Red Arrow Gallery,2500

Her canvases show the influence of both Classical compositions and Modernist geometry in equal measure.

Moving from walls to canvas, Green’s recent paintings, influenced by the art of the Edo Period in Japan and created with gesso and sumi ink, incorporate his signature style of figurative abstraction and use of letterforms while at the same time posing metaphysical questions about the nature of narrative, the physics of time, and the possibility of immortality.

Portraits of friends and strangers compose the bulk of her output, which also includes images of hands, faces, brains, mountains, and food, among other subjects. In her portraits, she merges a naturalistic and surrealistic approach. Harris depicts faceless heads on barely visible necks and shoulders; heads that appear to be dissipating like smoke; and doubled, fragmented faces, as if reflected in a cracked mirror. Harris only uses a computer to plan her compositions, which she executes entirely by hand. She describes her work as having “a timeless look that won’t go in or out of fashion.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch28\artsy-0001397.jpg,Painting,Circle Culture,

Morales also paints figurative works that suggest scenes of violence, with doubled over figures obscured beneath jagged strokes of crimson gesture. She has exhibited in Beirut, Paris, Berlin, Dallas, and Mexico City, and has been included in an institutional show at the MACAY in Mérida, Mexico.

Societal pressures and the built environment in Los Angeles, where Ruby lives and works, have served as frequent themes—his pieces have explored how architecture can influence human psychology. Ruby received his BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago before pursuing an MFA at the ArtCenter College of Design.

Interior and landscape scenes dominate Heidkamp’s compositions: Favorite subjects include Central Park, the sun-baked French Riviera, and woodlands and seascapes from the artist’s native New England. Heidkamp straddles realism and abstraction as he privileges mood over faithful reproduction. He uses smooth brushstrokes and saturated hues to evoke a sense of the extraordinary and ethereal in the everyday. The artist has embraced both plein air painting and compositions inspired by his own memories.

artsy-0001420.jpg,1972,Andy Warhol,11-04-2023,Description,"Obsessed with celebrity, consumer culture, and mechanical reproduction, Pop artist Andy Warhol created some of the 20th century’s most iconic images. He drew widely from popular culture and everyday subject matter in his most famous works: his 32 Campbell's soup cans, Brillo pad box sculptures, and portraits of Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, for example. Rejecting the dominant painting and sculpting modes of his day, Warhol embraced silk-screen printmaking to achieve his characteristic hard edges and flat areas of color. The artist mentored Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and continues to influence contemporary art around the world: His provocative successors include Richard Prince, Takashi Murakami, and Jeff Koons. Warhol has been the subject of exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern, and Centre Pompidou, among other institutions.

Beard’s interest in Africa can be traced to his trips to the continent in the 1950s and ’60s, which he viewed as escapes from the high society into which he was born. During the 1970s, Beard began working for fashion magazines and became a fixture at Studio 54. Although separated by an ocean, both bodies of work are concerned with a certain kind of brutality and virulence. Beard later turned to photo-collage to bridge these two oeuvres, adding elements such as news clippings and his own blood to further explicate the themes of violence.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch29\artsy-0001427.jpg,Photography,Forum Auctions,

Through his installations, sculptures, drawings, and paintings, Hirst explores themes including religion, mortality, and desire. Since 1988, when the artist developed and curated “Freeze,” a groundbreaking exhibition of his work and that of his Goldsmiths College peers, he has been the subject of major shows at Tate Modern in London, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

artsy-0001463.jpg,2023,Malcolm T. Liepke,11-04-2023,Description,"Largely self-taught, Malcolm T. Liepke paints in a style that synthesizes the work of other artists—John Singer Sargent, Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Diego Velázquez, and James McNeill Whistler, among others—to create portraits that are both visually familiar and wholly unique. Liepke favors portraits of ordinary women in glamorous contexts, producing voyeuristic nudes that are sexualized through a realistic lens rather than a pornographic one. Loose brushstrokes and dusty gray-green skin tones imbue his subjects with a fleshy sensuality, while simple gestures and expressions convey emotions. Liepke paints from photographs and works in a wet-on-wet technique, borrowed from artists like Sargent and Velázquez, in which layers of oil paint are built up without drying in between.

The artist begins each work by applying acrylic paint to wax paper, fashioning thousands of brightly-colored ovals and drips. Once dry, the artist peels off these shapes—each one unique and hand-crafted—and layers them onto canvas or paper to create his highly-textured pieces. Chacon compares this process to a social gathering, as he brings together a variety of disparate elements into a single unit. For a recent series, Chacon looked to the culture and myths of Ancient Rome, producing monochromatic paintings in deep purples and golds that reflect the society’s imperial colors.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch29\artsy-0001469.jpg,Painting,Dope!

Throughout his frames, Araki has captured flowers, food, figurines, and bodies with a distinct sensuality that reaches its apex in his close-up shots of female genitalia, pictures of women in traditional Japanese rope bondage, and photographs of Tokyo sex clubs. His style is deliberately casual, and he has worked in both color and black and white. Araki’s famous early series “Sentimental Voyage,” from 1971, depicts both the intimate and banal moments of his honeymoon. Though he has been arrested repeatedly in Japan for breaking obscenity laws, his work has been widely celebrated: Araki has been the subject of exhibitions at Tate Modern, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Albertina Museum in Vienna, among other institutions.

To make his series “Rauchbilder” (German for “smoke pictures”), he applied solvent to pigmented paper and lit it on fire, developing images in the residual soot. Piene also built large-scale public projects that he called “Sky Art”; some incorporated helium-filled sculptures. In his “Light Ballets,” he projected light through perforated globes, columns, and other materials. For nearly 20 years, Piene served as the director of the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 2008, he co-founded the International ZERO Foundation with Heinz Mack and Günther Uecker to archive documents, projects, and images produced by Group Zero.

Smoothly layered on the canvas surface against a darker gray background, his multicolored volumetric circles or “cells” look like droplets of blood or molecules viewed under a microscope. Emerging as a prominent artist in New York during the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, Bleckner’s paintings, like memento mori, often suggest meditations on the body, health, disease, and especially AIDS-related death.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch29\artsy-0001472.jpg,Painting,Gallery NAGA,900

Among his better-known series are a number of works dedicated to the Tower of Babel and fantastical architecture (2001-2006), and a humorous and fantastical body of self-portraits (2000-2002).

Fyfe’s works document regional transitions and globalization through his selected materials.

Hem’s paintings typically highlight an individual within a group of figures, homing in on the one person who is often somberly staring out from the canvas. Using a cool palette in which the colors do not quite match up with the real world, the artist creates somber moods in illusionistic spaces set at a remove from reality.

Educated as a figurative painter, he moved towards abstraction after a trip to Europe that exposed him to the major movements in modernism.

Boltanski often made metaphorical use of found objects, as in No Man’s Land (2010), an enormous pile of discarded jackets set to the soundtrack of thousands of human heartbeats, suggesting the anonymity, randomness, and inevitability of death. In Monuments (1985), electrical bulbs cast a seemingly bittersweet light on pictures of child holocaust victims. Describing his interest in personal histories, Boltanski said, “What drives me as an artist is that I think everyone is unique, yet everyone disappears so quickly.

They call their work the “Antimatter” series, in reference to their atomized, ghostly renderings of subjects, ranging from friends to kawaii (cute) Japanese girls, to philosophers. Both classically trained artists, the brothers honed their approach to portraiture through ten years of experimentation and travel, during which they eschewed the gallery system, presenting their work in unconventional spaces like nightclubs and corporate buildings.

The prolific artist is especially well known for his paintings of Ada, his wife and muse. Katz developed his signature style as a reaction against the Abstract Expressionism that dominated the mid–20th century, when he began painting. Instead, he embraced narrative, figurative clarity and the accessible pleasures of Pop art, though he remains untethered to any particular school or movement. Katz studied at Cooper Union in New York and spent a summer learning plein air painting at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture before he began presenting regularly in New York and cities across the world. His work has been included in shows at institutions such as the Whitney Museum of American Art, the National Portrait Gallery in London, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and the Fosun Foundation in Shanghai, among others.

In the 1980s—alongside fellow artists Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Kenny Scharf—Futura began exhibiting works on canvas in fine art gallery settings.

He has also made artworks that involve layering paint atop photographs and works by other artists. In the 1950s, Rainer riffed on the Surrealist practice of automatism and made a series of paintings while wearing a blindfold. His techniques made him a pioneer of the major mid-century European abstraction movement Art Informel. Rainer has exhibited in New York, London, Vienna, Paris, Berlin, and Munich.

Kitaj was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1982. In 1985, he became the first American to be elected to the Royal Academy since 1894, when John Singer Sargent was elected.

Believing that “the camera always separates the subject from the viewer,” Derges seeks to eliminate this mediation by exposing her photographic paper directly to nature—capturing ambient light in riverbeds, refracted faces in water droplets, and the shadows of leaves and trees in photograms. “This is essentially more about print-making rather than photography,” she has said. “I'm painting with light—or least, that's the way it feels to me.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch30\artsy-0001531.jpg,Photography,Gallery Henoch,17000

Stepping away from the notion of ceramics as a functional craft, Wedel’s art enters the realm of mythological creation stories. Intent on recreating the world from mud or clay, he intricately models vegetation, minerals, and animals—all of which, while familiar, suggest they have roots in the unknown. His works are complex yet fluid with simple but commanding saturated color. Recognizing that “there is baggage with being a medium-specific ceramic artist today,” Wedel states his art strives to “explore the medium and expand on [its] history.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch30\artsy-0001535.jpg,Painting,Winston Wächter Fine Art,10000

The compositions often assume circular forms, adopted by Cohen from Buddhist Enso painting, where the circle is used as a spiritual and metaphorical figure.

Reflecting the language of dreams, these dark, hyperrealistic tableaux suggest bizarre and intriguing narratives. Cheifetz paints alla prima, an oil painting technique in which wet paint is applied to previous layers of wet paint. He works without detailed underpainting or studies, creating atmosphere through prominent, expressive brushstrokes and strong chiaroscuro. “I like to have my paintings structural and precise but at the same time loose,” he says. “I like how you can create focus in a painting by making the center of interest tight, and then you can get loose as you get more peripheral because those other things aren’t as important.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch30\artsy-0001539.jpg,Painting,Shapero Modern,

Her poupées are provocative, erotic, and uninhibitedly sexual, and function as an extension of the artist’s feelings. Now based in Barcelona, Miss Van focuses almost exclusively on studio art. Since shifting from the outdoors to an indoor setting, Miss Van’s poupées have grown increasingly refined due to the artist’s exploration of new materials and techniques. Her recent “Ballerina” series features poupées in anthropomorphic masks.

An ally of the German artist group Zero, Bonalumi—along with peers and friends Enrico Castellani and Piero Manzoni—was inspired by Lucio Fontana’s sliced canvases. He elaborated upon Fontana’s work, developing what he called “extroflexions”—intricate stretchers that molded his vinyl-coated monochromatic canvases and suggested a force pushing out from beneath. In the 1960s, Bonalumi expanded his materials to include metals, and he enlarged the scale of his work, ultimately creating installations.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch31\artsy-0001557.jpg,Painting,Robert Fontaine Gallery,5500

Though the human figure is absent, the scenes do not lack intimacy, thanks to subtle clues, like a steaming cup of coffee, barely eaten fruit, or a book of poetry laid carelessly on an unfolded tablecloth. The painter offers us an invitation to leisure or a seat at a table. He sets the scene and leaves it to us to imagine its narrative. These interiors recall the comfort of one’s home. Through warm and vivid colors, Arlaud shows a mastery of his palette, juxtaposing shades in order to form luminous oppositions. Arlaud chooses his subjects from his daily life. He appreciates photography, and his paintings are poetic transcriptions of captured images.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch31\artsy-0001562.jpg,Painting,Susan Eley Fine Art,800

artsy-0001566.jpg,2009,Peter Waite,11-04-2023,Description,"“I make paintings that document my travels—real visits to real places—to sites that embody public sentiment or ideological concerns,” Peter Waite has explained. Exploring overlooked architectural spaces in cities worldwide, Waite creates precisely rendered, evocative paintings based on his travels. He works primarily at large-scale and in acrylic on panel and has painted museum galleries, escalators, colonnaded passageways, and disused swimming pools at places both iconic and ordinary. Sometimes he interrupts these images with thin, fluorescent lines; other times he primes his panels with neon-colored coatings of paint, which lend a subtle glow to his compositions. Especially interested in how such places reflect the ideals of the societies for which they were built, Waite omits human figures from his depictions. In doing so, he encourages viewers to focus on the structural details of the sites and to consider the myriad ways one might experience them.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch31\artsy-0001566.jpg,Painting,Hecho Gallery,4900

He arranges the layers of paper in a horizontal grid, paying homage to pioneering Modernists and Minimalists such as Piet Mondrian, Kenneth Noland, and Morris Louis. A resin topcoat renders the surface shiny and the paper transparent, so that the images on the backsides bleed through to the front, creating a sense of depth. Paying attention to what is behind each piece of paper “makes the collage more interesting and creates a certain mood,” he says. Verbicky’s collages, which can be “read” in any direction, evoke familiar scenes and subjects, from flowers in bloom, to a racetrack blurred in action, to stock tickers scrolling across a television screen.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch31\artsy-0001569.jpg,Mixed Media,Matéria Gallery,4000

With this subtractive process, Vhils unites elements of painting and sculpture and reflects on how the built environment absorbs social changes and development. Vhils studied at Central Saint Martins and honed his practice as a graffiti artist. His studio now makes prints, paintings, and posters. Vhils has exhibited in cities across the globe and produced collaborations with a number of institutions including the EDP Foundation in Lisbon, the Centre Pompidou, the Barbican Centre, the CAFA Art Museum, and the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch31\artsy-0001571.jpg,Sculpture,Taylor | Graham,25000

Influenced by the first generation of Abstract Expressionists, he sought a style even further removed from mimesis and preoccupied entirely with surface, color, and medium. Beginning with drawing and a schema, he would build layers of abstraction to explore spirituality and eroticism through paint, altogether eschewing narrative content or figuration.

His materials ranged from trash and earth to dust and stone, which created a sense of solidity and physicality throughout his oeuvre. Tàpies participated in the Venice Biennale four times and exhibited in cities including Paris, London, Barcelona, Brussels, Berlin, Tokyo, Zürich, and New York.

In her beguiling portraits—including many self-portraits—she captured her subjects blurred in motion or partially hidden behind furniture. Woodman’s compositions, aided by her long exposures, offer ghostly meditations on sexuality, identity, and the construction of the self. Woodman studied at the Rhode Island School of Design, where she developed her practice as she took inspiration from Surrealist photographers such as Man Ray and Claude Cahun. She did not exhibit widely before her untimely death at age 22, but her work has since been shown in New York, Zürich, Berlin, Rome, Paris, and London, and has been included in institutional shows at the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson, the Vertical Gallery of the Verbund Collection, the Guggenheim Museum, and Tate Modern, among others.

Fernandez’s expressive cast of stylized figures with exaggerated features and unnatural flesh tones are proxies for the viewer to connect their own present circumstances.

artsy-0001619.jpg,2017,Tatsuo Miyajima 宮島 達男,11-04-2023,Description,"Digital tickers and LED lights are the building blocks of Tatsuo Miyajima’s sculpture and installation works. Miyajima operates within specific material parameters: his LED lights come in a limited range of color, and count up or down between numbers 1 and 9 without ever reaching 0. He uses this limited range, however, in order to look for individuality: he has presented counters in a multitude of iterations, using both geometric and organic compositions. While critics and curators see the influence of Serial Art in Miyajima’s practice, Miyajima explains that he draws more from Buddhism. For the artist, the ticking numbers are tied to inevitability, universality, and mortality. Miyajima states: “I am making installations which experiment with different systems of time,” adding that, “There is no absolute length of time, only a personal rhythm.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch32\artsy-0001619.jpg,Print,Visions West Contemporary,20000

In addition to his street art, C215 has produced works expressing his social concerns; his stenciled acrylic rendering of four young children, Favela Boys (2008), is one example. He has also produced portraits of leading global figures including former U.S. president Barack Obama and French cultural icon Serge Gainsbourg. C215 travels to neglected areas to create his large-scale murals, many of which can occupy the entire side of a building.

The artist often incorporates craft elements into her intricate, usually site-specific works, further complicating boundaries between art and domestic labor. Vasconcelos’s conceptual and formal concerns are exemplified in works such as A Noiva (The Bride) (2001–05), a six-meter-tall chandelier made from 25,000 tampons. She presented the piece at the 2005 Venice Biennale.

artsy-0001673.jpg,1995,Per Kirkeby,11-04-2023,Description,"Inspired by his early training as a geologist, Per Kirkeby made quasi-abstract paintings of landscapes. He was influenced by the gestural works of mid-century Abstract Expressionism and was often labeled a Neo-Expressionist. The artist rendered his scenes with thick, aggressive strokes of earthen hues and glints of yellow and blue; outlining trees, boulders, and figures in black, he kept his work from pure abstraction. Throughout his five-decade career, Kirkeby also pursued architecture, poetry, and sculpture, and he worked on visual effects for the films of Lars von Trier. As an early member of the experimental Fluxus group, he participated in performances and Happenings organized by Joseph Beuys and Jörg Immendorff. Kirkeby exhibited widely during his lifetime and enjoyed solo shows in New York, Paris, Copenhagen, London, and Cologne. He represented Denmark at the Venice Biennale in 1976 and 1980.

He produced assemblages, installations, performances, prints, and drawings, among other media, which usually embraced a philosophical, humanist message. Various projects involved planting trees, living with a coyote for three days, and teaching itself: The artist was an influential instructor at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf whose students included Anatol Herzfeld, Blinky Palermo, and Sigmar Polke. Beuys participated in the Venice Biennale and Documenta many times and has been the subject of exhibitions at institutions including Moderna Museet, Tate Modern, the Kunsthalle Bern, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art, among others.

Weaser studied abstract, non-objective painting, though her earliest works were sanded wall sculptures. Her best-known body of paintings borrows from both approaches. She begins each work by applying layers of color to wood panel, and then covers the surface in an overlay of white paint. Later, she sands away the layers—a process she calls “excavation”—to create compositions that resemble reflections of forests on water. Weaser explains: “The trees reflecting on a watery plain reveal a shimmering version rather than a solid fact. My paintings are a desire to . . . reconnect to the unseen as a resonating poetic experience.”",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch34\artsy-0001683.jpg,Painting,GALLERY MoMo,860

artsy-0001695.jpg,478,Mario Schifano,11-04-2023,Description,"Mario Schifano was a pivotal Italian artist recognized for his oeuvre within various movements such as Pop Art and Arte Povera. He first gained recognition for his “Monochrome” series (1960-62) of paintings rendered in industrial enamel on paper with delineated fields of flat color. Later paintings isolated sections of famous brand logos, which became some of the most famous instances of Italian Pop Art, shown alongside contemporaries such as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. In the late 1960s, he turned to landscapes, which manifested as semi-abstract compositions often left half-finished, showing the paper underneath. Schifano’s work has been widely exhibited, including a retrospective at Rome’s National Gallery of Modern Art, and his experimentation with form and cultural iconography secured his legacy as a significant figure in 20th-century Italian art.",ArtsyScrape\artsy_images\batch34\artsy-0001695.jpg,Painting,Lions Gallery,1500
